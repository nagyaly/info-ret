VENUS AND ADONIS



Vilia miretur vulgus mihi flavus Apollo
Pocula Castalia plena ministret aqua




TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE
HENRY WRIOTHESLEY EARL OF SOUTHAMPTON
and Baron of Titchfield

Right Honourable I know not how I shall offend in dedicating my
unpolished lines to your lordship nor how the world will censure me
for choosing so strong a prop to support so weak a burthen only if
your honour seem but pleased I account myself highly praised and vow
to take advantage of all idle hours till I have honoured you with some
graver labour But if the first heir of my invention prove deformed I
shall be sorry it had so noble a godfather and never after ear so
barren a land for fear it yield me still so bad a harvest I leave it
to your honourable survey and your honour to your hearts content
which I wish may always answer your own wish and the worlds hopeful
expectation

Your honours in all duty
WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE






VENUS AND ADONIS

Even as the sun with purplecolourd face
Had taen his last leave of the weeping morn
Rosecheekd Adonis tried him to the chase
Hunting he lovd but love he laughd to scorn    4
Sickthoughted Venus makes amain unto him
And like a boldfacd suitor gins to woo him

Thrice fairer than myself thus she began
The fields chief flower sweet above compare    8
Stain to all nymphs more lovely than a man
More white and red than doves or roses are
Nature that made thee with herself at strife
Saith that the world hath ending with thy life   12

Vouchsafe thou wonder to alight thy steed
And rein his proud head to the saddlebow
If thou wilt deign this favour for thy meed
A thousand honey secrets shalt thou know       16
Here come and sit where never serpent hisses
And being set Ill smother thee with kisses

And yet not cloy thy lips with loathd satiety
But rather famish them amid their plenty       20
Making them red and pale with fresh variety
Ten kisses short as one one long as twenty
A summers day will seem an hour but short
Being wasted in such timebeguiling sport     24

With this she seizeth on his sweating palm
The precedent of pith and livelihood
And trembling in her passion calls it balm
Earths sovereign salve to do a goddess good     28
Being so enragd desire doth lend her force
Courageously to pluck him from his horse

Over one arm the lusty coursers rein
Under her other was the tender boy          32
Who blushd and pouted in a dull disdain
With leaden appetite unapt to toy
She red and hot as coals of glowing fire
He red for shame but frosty in desire       36

The studded bridle on a ragged bough
Nimbly she fastensO how quick is love
The steed is stalled up and even now
To tie the rider she begins to prove         40
Backward she pushd him as she would be thrust
And governd him in strength though not in lust

So soon was she along as he was down
Each leaning on their elbows and their hips     44
Now doth she stroke his cheek now doth he frown
And gins to chide but soon she stops his lips
And kissing speaks with lustful language broken
If thou wilt chide thy lips shall never open  48

He burns with bashful shame she with her tears
Doth quench the maiden burning of his cheeks
Then with her windy sighs and golden hairs
To fan and blow them dry again she seeks       52
He saith she is immodest blames her miss
What follows more she murders with a kiss

Even as an empty eagle sharp by fast
Tires with her beak on feathers flesh and bone   56
Shaking her wings devouring all in haste
Till either gorge be stuffd or prey be gone
Even so she kissd his brow his cheek his chin
And where she ends she doth anew begin       60

Forcd to content but never to obey
Panting he lies and breatheth in her face
She feedeth on the steam as on a prey
And calls it heavenly moisture air of grace     64
Wishing her cheeks were gardens full of flowers
So they were dewd with such distilling showers

Look how a bird lies tangled in a net
So fastend in her arms Adonis lies         68
Pure shame and awd resistance made him fret
Which bred more beauty in his angry eyes
Rain added to a river that is rank
Perforce will force it overflow the bank      72

Still she entreats and prettily entreats
For to a pretty ear she tunes her tale
Still is he sullen still he lours and frets
Twixt crimson shame and anger ashy pale       76
Being red she loves him best and being white
Her best is betterd with a more delight

Look how he can she cannot choose but love
And by her fair immortal hand she swears       80
From his soft bosom never to remove
Till he take truce with her contending tears
Which long have raind making her cheeks all wet
And one sweet kiss shall pay this countless debt

Upon this promise did he raise his chin        85
Like a divedapper peering through a wave
Who being lookd on ducks as quickly in
So offers he to give what she did crave        88
But when her lips were ready for his pay
He winks and turns his lips another way

Never did passenger in summers heat
More thirst for drink than she for this good turn  92
Her help she sees but help she cannot get
She bathes in water yet her fire must burn
O pity gan she cry flinthearted boy
Tis but a kiss I beg why art thou coy      96

I have been wood as I entreat thee now
Even by the stern and direful god of war
Whose sinewy neck in battle neer did bow
Who conquers where he comes in every jar       100
Yet hath he been my captive and my slave
And beggd for that which thou unaskd shalt have

Over my altars hath he hung his lance
His batterd shield his uncontrolled crest     104
And for my sake hath learnd to sport and dance
To toy to wanton dally smile and jest
Scorning his churlish drum and ensign red
Making my arms his field his tent my bed     108

Thus he that overruld I overswayd
Leading him prisoner in a red rose chain
Strongtemperd steel his stronger strength obeyd
Yet was he servile to my coy disdain        112
Oh be not proud nor brag not of thy might
For mastring her that foild the god of fight

Touch but my lips with those fair lips of thine
Though mine be not so fair yet are they red    116
The kiss shall be thine own as well as mine
What seest thou in the ground hold up thy head
Look in mine eyeballs there thy beauty lies
Then why not lips on lips since eyes in eyes   120

Art thou ashamd to kiss then wink again
And I will wink so shall the day seem night
Love keeps his revels where there are but twain
Be bold to play our sport is not in sight     124
These blueveind violets whereon we lean
Never can blab nor know not what we mean

The tender spring upon thy tempting lip       127
Shows thee unripe yet mayst thou well be tasted
Make use of time let not advantage slip
Beauty within itself should not be wasted
Fair flowers that are not gatherd in their prime
Rot and consume themselves in little time     132

Were I hardfavourd foul or wrinkled old
Illnurturd crooked churlish harsh in voice
Oerworn despised rheumatic and cold
Thicksighted barren lean and lacking juice   136
Then mightst thou pause for then I were not for thee
But having no defects why dost abhor me

Thou canst not see one wrinkle in my brow      139
Mine eyes are grey and bright and quick in turning
My beauty as the spring doth yearly grow
My flesh is soft and plump my marrow burning
My smooth moist hand were it with thy hand felt
Would in thy palm dissolve or seem to melt    144

Bid me discourse I will enchant thine ear
Or like a fairy trip upon the green
Or like a nymph with long dishevelld hair
Dance on the sands and yet no footing seen     148
Love is a spirit all compact of fire
Not gross to sink but light and will aspire

Witness this primrose bank whereon I lie      151
These forceless flowers like sturdy trees support me
Two strengthless doves will draw me through the sky
From morn till night even where I list to sport me
Is love so light sweet boy and may it be
That thou shouldst think it heavy unto thee    156

Is thine own heart to thine own face affected
Can thy right hand seize love upon thy left
Then woo thyself be of thyself rejected
Steal thine own freedom and complain on theft   160
Narcissus so himself himself forsook
And died to kiss his shadow in the brook

Torches are made to light jewels to wear
Dainties to taste fresh beauty for the use     164
Herbs for their smell and sappy plants to bear
Things growing to themselves are growths abuse
Seeds spring from seeds and beauty breedeth beauty
Thou wast begot to get it is thy duty      168

Upon the earths increase why shouldst thou feed
Unless the earth with thy increase be fed
By law of nature thou art bound to breed
That thine may live when thou thyself art dead   172
And so in spite of death thou dost survive
In that thy likeness still is left alive

By this the lovesick queen began to sweat
For where they lay the shadow had forsook them   176
And Titan tired in the midday heat
With burning eye did hotly overlook them
Wishing Adonis had his team to guide
So he were like him and by Venus side      180

And now Adonis with a lazy spright
And with a heavy dark disliking eye
His louring brows oerwhelming his fair sight
Like misty vapours when they blot the sky      184
Souring his cheeks cries Fie no more of love
The sun doth burn my face I must remove

Ay me quoth Venus young and so unkind
What bare excuses makst thou to be gone      188
Ill sigh celestial breath whose gentle wind
Shall cool the heat of this descending sun
Ill make a shadow for thee of my hairs
If they burn too Ill quench them with my tears 192

The sun that shines from heaven shines but warm
And lo I lie between that sun and thee
The heat I have from thence doth little harm
Thine eye darts forth the fire that burneth me   196
And were I not immortal life were done
Between this heavenly and earthly sun

Art thou obdurate flinty hard as steel
Nay more than flint for stone at rain relenteth  200
Art thou a womans son and canst not feel
What tis to love how want of love tormenteth
O had thy mother borne so hard a mind
She had not brought forth thee but died unkind  204

What am I that thou shouldst contemn me this
Or what great danger dwells upon my suit
What were thy lips the worse for one poor kiss
Speak fair but speak fair words or else be mute 208
Give me one kiss Ill give it thee again
And one for intrest if thou wilt have twain

Fie lifeless picture cold and senseless stone
Wellpainted idol image dull and dead       212
Statue contenting but the eye alone
Thing like a man but of no woman bred
Thou art no man though of a mans complexion
For men will kiss even by their own direction  216

This said impatience chokes her pleading tongue
And swelling passion doth provoke a pause
Red cheeks and fiery eyes blaze forth her wrong
Being judge in love she cannot right her cause   220
And now she weeps and now she fain would speak
And now her sobs do her intendments break

Sometimes she shakes her head and then his hand
Now gazeth she on him now on the ground      224
Sometimes her arms infold him like a band
She would he will not in her arms be bound
And when from thence he struggles to be gone
She locks her lily fingers one in one       228

Fondling she saith since I have hemmd thee here
Within the circuit of this ivory pale
Ill be a park and thou shalt be my deer
Feed where thou wilt on mountain or in dale    232
Graze on my lips and if those hills be dry
Stray lower where the pleasant fountains lie

Within this limit is relief enough
Sweet bottom grass and high delightful plain    236
Round rising hillocks brakes obscure and rough
To shelter thee from tempest and from rain
Then be my deer since I am such a park      239
No dog shall rouse thee though a thousand bark

At this Adonis smiles as in disdain
That in each cheek appears a pretty dimple
Love made those hollows if himself were slain
He might be buried in a tomb so simple       244
Foreknowing well if there he came to lie
Why there love livd and there he could not die

These lovely caves these round enchanting pits
Opend their mouths to swallow Venus liking    248
Being mad before how doth she now for wits
Struck dead at first what needs a second striking
Poor queen of love in thine own law forlorn
To love a cheek that smiles at thee in scorn   252

Now which way shall she turn what shall she say
Her words are done her woes the more increasing
The time is spent her object will away
And from her twining arms doth urge releasing    256
Pity she cries some favour some remorse
Away he springs and hasteth to his horse

But lo from forth a copse that neighbours by
A breeding jennet lusty young and proud     260
Adonis tramping courser doth espy
And forth she rushes snorts and neighs aloud
The strongneckd steed being tied unto a tree
Breaketh his rein and to her straight goes he  264

Imperiously he leaps he neighs he bounds
And now his woven girths he breaks asunder
The bearing earth with his hard hoof he wounds
Whose hollow womb resounds like heavens thunder
The iron bit he crusheth tween his teeth     269
Controlling what he was controlled with

His ears upprickd his braided hanging mane
Upon his compassd crest now stand on end      272
His nostrils drink the air and forth again
As from a furnace vapours doth he send
His eye which scornfully glisters like fire
Shows his hot courage and his high desire     276

Sometime he trots as if he told the steps
With gentle majesty and modest pride
Anon he rears upright curvets and leaps
As who should say Lo thus my strength is tried
And this I do to captivate the eye         281
Of the fair breeder that is standing by

What recketh he his riders angry stir
His flattering Holla or his Stand I say    284
What cares he now for curb or pricking spur
For rich caparisons or trappings gay
He sees his love and nothing else he sees
Nor nothing else with his proud sight agrees   288

Look when a painter would surpass the life
In limning out a wellproportiond steed
His art with natures workmanship at strife
As if the dead the living should exceed       292
So did this horse excel a common one
In shape in courage colour pace and bone

Roundhoofd shortjointed fetlocks shag and long
Broad breast full eye small head and nostril wide
High crest short ears straight legs and passing strong
Thin mane thick tail broad buttock tender hide
Look what a horse should have he did not lack
Save a proud rider on so proud a back       300

Sometimes he scuds far off and there he stares
Anon he starts at stirring of a feather
To bid the wind a base he now prepares
And where he run or fly they know not whether    304
For through his mane and tail the high wind sings
Fanning the hairs who wave like featherd wings

He looks upon his love and neighs unto her
She answers him as if she knew his mind       308
Being proud as females are to see him woo her
She puts on outward strangeness seems unkind
Spurns at his love and scorns the heat he feels
Beating his kind embracements with her heels   312

Then like a melancholy malcontent
He vails his tail that like a falling plume
Cool shadow to his melting buttock lent
He stamps and bites the poor flies in his fume   316
His love perceiving how he was enragd
Grew kinder and his fury was assuagd

His testy master goeth about to take him
When lo the unbackd breeder full of fear     320
Jealous of catching swiftly doth forsake him
With her the horse and left Adonis there
As they were mad unto the wood they hie them
Outstripping crows that strive to overfly them  324

All swoln with chafing down Adonis sits
Banning his boisterous and unruly beast
And now the happy season once more fits
That lovesick love by pleading may be blest    328
For lovers say the heart hath treble wrong
When it is barrd the aidance of the tongue

An oven that is stoppd or river stayd
Burneth more hotly swelleth with more rage     332
So of concealed sorrow may be said
Free vent of words loves fire doth assuage
But when the hearts attorney once is mute
The client breaks as desperate in his suit    336

He sees her coming and begins to glow
Even as a dying coal revives with wind
And with his bonnet hides his angry brow
Looks on the dull earth with disturbed mind     340
Taking no notice that she is so nigh
For all askance he holds her in his eye

O what a sight it was wistly to view
How she came stealing to the wayward boy      344
To note the fighting conflict of her hue
How white and red each other did destroy
But now her cheek was pale and by and by
It flashd forth fire as lightning from the sky 348

Now was she just before him as he sat
And like a lowly lover down she kneels
With one fair hand she heaveth up his hat
Her other tender hand his fair cheek feels     352
His tendrer cheek receives her soft hands print
As apt as newfalln snow takes any dint

Oh what a war of looks was then between them
Her eyes petitioners to his eyes suing       356
His eyes saw her eyes as they had not seen them
Her eyes wood still his eyes disdaind the wooing
And all this dumb play had his acts made plain
With tears which choruslike her eyes did rain

Full gently now she takes him by the hand      361
A lily prisond in a gaol of snow
Or ivory in an alabaster band
So white a friend engirts so white a foe      364
This beauteous combat wilful and unwilling
Showd like two silver doves that sit abilling

Once more the engine of her thoughts began
O fairest mover on this mortal round        368
Would thou wert as I am and I a man
My heart all whole as thine thy heart my wound
For one sweet look thy help I would assure thee
Though nothing but my bodys bane would cure thee

Give me my hand saith he why dost thou feel it
Give me my heart saith she and thou shalt have it
O give it me lest thy hard heart do steel it
And being steeld soft sighs can never grave it  376
Then loves deep groans I never shall regard
Because Adonis heart hath made mine hard

For shame he cries let go and let me go
My days delight is past my horse is gone     380
And tis your fault I am bereft him so
I pray you hence and leave me here alone
For all my mind my thought my busy care
Is how to get my palfrey from the mare      384

Thus she replies Thy palfrey as he should
Welcomes the warm approach of sweet desire
Affection is a coal that must be coold
Else sufferd it will set the heart on fire    388
The sea hath bounds but deep desire hath none
Therefore no marvel though thy horse be gone

How like a jade he stood tied to the tree
Servilely masterd with a leathern rein       392
But when he saw his love his youths fair fee
He held such petty bondage in disdain
Throwing the base thong from his bending crest
Enfranchising his mouth his back his breast   396

Who sees his truelove in her naked bed
Teaching the sheets a whiter hue than white
But when his glutton eye so full hath fed
His other agents aim at like delight        400
Who is so faint that dare not be so bold
To touch the fire the weather being cold

Let me excuse thy courser gentle boy
And learn of him I heartily beseech thee      404
To take advantage on presented joy
Though I were dumb yet his proceedings teach thee
O learn to love the lesson is but plain
And once made perfect never lost again     408

I know not love quoth he nor will not know it
Unless it be a boar and then I chase it
Tis much to borrow and I will not owe it
My love to love is love but to disgrace it     412
For I have heard it is a life in death
That laughs and weeps and all but with a breath

Who wears a garment shapeless and unfinishd
Who plucks the bud before one leaf put forth    416
If springing things be any jot diminishd
They wither in their prime prove nothing worth
The colt thats backd and burdend being young
Loseth his pride and never waxeth strong     420

You hurt my hand with wringing Let us part
And leave this idle theme this bootless chat
Remove your siege from my unyielding heart
To loves alarms it will not ope the gate      424
Dismiss your vows your feigned tears your flattry
For where a heart is hard they make no battry

What canst thou talk quoth she hast thou a tongue
O would thou hadst not or I had no hearing    428
Thy mermaids voice hath done me double wrong
I had my load before now pressd with bearing
Melodious discord heavenly tune harshsounding
Ears deep sweet music and hearts deep sore wounding

Had I no eyes but ears my ears would love     433
That inward beauty and invisible
Or were I deaf thy outward parts would move
Each part in me that were but sensible       436
Though neither eyes nor ears to hear nor see
Yet should I be in love by touching thee

Say that the sense of feeling were bereft me
And that I could not see nor hear nor touch    440
And nothing but the very smell were left me
Yet would my love to thee be still as much
For from the stillitory of thy face excelling
Comes breath perfumd that breedeth love by smelling

But oh what banquet wert thou to the taste     445
Being nurse and feeder of the other four
Would they not wish the feast might ever last
And bid suspicion doublelock the door
Lest jealousy that sour unwelcome guest
Should by his stealing in disturb the feast   448

Once more the rubycolourd portal opend
Which to his speech did honey passage yield     452
Like a red morn that ever yet betokend
Wrack to the seaman tempest to the field
Sorrow to shepherds woe unto the birds
Gusts and foul flaws to herdmen and to herds   456

This ill presage advisedly she marketh
Even as the wind is hushd before it raineth
Or as the wolf doth grin before he barketh
Or as the berry breaks before it staineth      460
Or like the deadly bullet of a gun
His meaning struck her ere his words begun

And at his look she flatly falleth down
For looks kill love and love by looks reviveth   464
A smile recures the wounding of a frown
But blessed bankrout that by love so thriveth
The silly boy believing she is dead
Claps her pale cheek till clapping makes it red 468

And all amazd brake off his late intent
For sharply he did think to reprehend her
Which cunning love did wittily prevent
Fair fall the wit that can so well defend her    472
For on the grass she lies as she were slain
Till his breath breatheth life in her again

He wrings her nose he strikes her on the cheeks
He bends her fingers holds her pulses hard     476
He chafes her lips a thousand ways he seeks
To mend the hurt that his unkindness marrd
He kisses her and she by her good will
Will never rise so he will kiss her still    480

The night of sorrow now is turnd to day
Her two blue windows faintly she upheaveth
Like the fair sun when in his fresh array
He cheers the morn and all the world relieveth   484
And as the bright sun glorifies the sky
So is her face illumind with her eye

Whose beams upon his hairless face are fixd
As if from thence they borrowd all their shine   488
Were never four such lamps together mixd
Had not his clouded with his brows repine
But hers which through the crystal tears gave light
Shone like the moon in water seen by night    492

O where am I quoth she in earth or heaven
Or in the ocean drenchd or in the fire
What hour is this or morn or weary even
Do I delight to die or life desire         496
But now I livd and life was deaths annoy
But now I died and death was lively joy

O thou didst kill me kill me once again
Thy eyes shrewd tutor that hard heart of thine  500
Hath taught them scornful tricks and such disdain
That they have murderd this poor heart of mine
And these mine eyes true leaders to their queen
But for thy piteous lips no more had seen     504

Long may they kiss each other for this cure
Oh never let their crimson liveries wear
And as they last their verdure still endure
To drive infection from the dangerous year     508
That the stargazers having writ on death
May say the plague is banishd by thy breath

Pure lips sweet seals in my soft lips imprinted
What bargains may I make still to be sealing    512
To sell myself I can be well contented
So thou wilt buy and pay and use good dealing
Which purchase if thou make for fear of slips
Set thy seal manual on my waxred lips      516

A thousand kisses buys my heart from me
And pay them at thy leisure one by one
What is ten hundred touches unto thee
Are they not quickly told and quickly gone     520
Say for nonpayment that the debt should double
Is twenty hundred kisses such a trouble

Fair queen quoth he if any love you owe me
Measure my strangeness with my unripe years     524
Before I know myself seek not to know me
No fisher but the ungrown fry forbears
The mellow plum doth fall the green sticks fast
Or being early pluckd is sour to taste     528

Look the worlds comforter with weary gait
His days hot task hath ended in the west
The owl nights herald shrieks tis very late
The sheep are gone to fold birds to their nest   532
And coalblack clouds that shadow heavens light
Do summon us to part and bid good night

Now let me say good night and so say you
If you will say so you shall have a kiss     536
Good night quoth she and ere he says adieu
The honey fee of parting tenderd is
Her arms do lend his neck a sweet embrace
Incorporate then they seem face grows to face  540

Till breathless he disjoind and backward drew
The heavenly moisture that sweet coral mouth
Whose precious taste her thirsty lips well knew
Whereon they surfeit yet complain on drouth    544
He with her plenty pressd she faint with dearth
Their lips together glued fall to the earth

Now quick desire hath caught the yielding prey
And gluttonlike she feeds yet never filleth    548
Her lips are conquerors his lips obey
Paying what ransom the insulter willeth
Whose vulture thought doth pitch the price so high
That she will draw his lips rich treasure dry  552

And having felt the sweetness of the spoil
With blindfold fury she begins to forage
Her face doth reek and smoke her blood doth boil
And careless lust stirs up a desperate courage   556
Planting oblivion beating reason back
Forgetting shames pure blush and honours wrack

Hot faint and weary with her hard embracing
Like a wild bird being tamd with too much handling
Or as the fleetfoot roe thats tird with chasing 561
Or like the froward infant stilld with dandling
He now obeys and now no more resisteth
While she takes all she can not all she listeth 564

What wax so frozen but dissolves with tempring
And yields at last to every light impression
Things out of hope are compassd oft with ventring
Chiefly in love whose leave exceeds commission   568
Affection faints not like a palefacd coward
But then woos best when most his choice is froward

When he did frown O had she then gave over
Such nectar from his lips she had not suckd    572
Foul words and frowns must not repel a lover
What though the rose have prickles yet tis pluckd
Were beauty under twenty locks kept fast
Yet love breaks through and picks them all at last

For pity now she can no more detain him       577
The poor fool prays her that he may depart
She is resolvd no longer to restrain him
Bids him farewell and look well to her heart    580
The which by Cupids bow she doth protest
He carries thence encaged in his breast

Sweet boy she says this night Ill waste in sorrow
For my sick heart commands mine eyes to watch    584
Tell me loves master shall we meet tomorrow
Say shall we shall we wilt thou make the match
He tells her no tomorrow he intends
To hunt the boar with certain of his friends   588

The boar quoth she whereat a sudden pale
Like lawn being spread upon the blushing rose
Usurps her cheek she trembles at his tale
And on his neck her yoking arms she throws     592
She sinketh down still hanging by his neck
He on her belly falls she on her back

Now is she in the very lists of love
Her champion mounted for the hot encounter     596
All is imaginary she doth prove
He will not manage her although he mount her
That worse than Tantalus is her annoy
To clip Elysium and to lack her joy        600

Even as poor birds deceivd with painted grapes
Do surfeit by the eye and pine the maw
Even so she languisheth in her mishaps
As those poor birds that helpless berries saw    604
The warm effects which she in him finds missing
She seeks to kindle with continual kissing

But all in vain good queen it will not be
She hath assayd as much as may be provd      608
Her pleading hath deservd a greater fee
Shes love she loves and yet she is not lovd
Fie fie he says you crush me let me go
You have no reason to withhold me so       612

Thou hadst been gone quoth she sweet boy ere this
But that thou toldst me thou wouldst hunt the boar
Oh be advisd thou knowst not what it is
With javelins point a churlish swine to gore    616
Whose tushes never sheathd he whetteth still
Like to a mortal butcher bent to kill

On his bowback he hath a battle set
Of bristly pikes that ever threat his foes     620
His eyes like glowworms shine when he doth fret
His snout digs sepulchres whereer he goes
Being movd he strikes whateer is in his way
And whom he strikes his crooked tushes slay    624

His brawny sides with hairy bristles armed
Are better proof than thy spears point can enter
His short thick neck cannot be easily harmed
Being ireful on the lion he will venture      628
The thorny brambles and embracing bushes
As fearful of him part through whom he rushes

Alas he naught esteems that face of thine
To which loves eyes pay tributary gazes      632
Nor thy soft hands sweet lips and crystal eyne
Whose full perfection all the world amazes
But having thee at vantage wondrous dread
Would root these beauties as he roots the mead

Oh let him keep his loathsome cabin still     637
Beauty hath naught to do with such foul fiends
Come not within his danger by thy will
They that thrive well take counsel of their friends
When thou didst name the boar not to dissemble
I feard thy fortune and my joints did tremble

Didst thou not mark my face was it not white
Sawst thou not signs of fear lurk in mine eye   644
Grew I not faint and fell I not downright
Within my bosom whereon thou dost lie
My boding heart pants beats and takes no rest
But like an earthquake shakes thee on my breast

For where love reigns disturbing jealousy     649
Doth call himself affections sentinel
Gives false alarms suggesteth mutiny
And in a peaceful hour doth cry Kill kill    652
Distempring gentle love in his desire
As air and water do abate the fire

This sour informer this batebreeding spy
This canker that eats up loves tender spring    656
This carrytale dissentious jealousy
That sometime true news sometime false doth bring
Knocks at my heart and whispers in mine ear
That if I love thee I thy death should fear   660

And more than so presenteth to mine eye
The picture of an angry chafing boar
Under whose sharp fangs on his back doth lie
An image like thyself all staind with gore    664
Whose blood upon the fresh flowers being shed
Doth make them droop with grief and hang the head

What should I do seeing thee so indeed
That tremble at thimagination           668
The thought of it doth make my faint heart bleed
And fear doth teach it divination
I prophesy thy death my living sorrow
If thou encounter with the boar tomorrow     672

But if thou needs wilt hunt be ruld by me
Uncouple at the timorous flying hare
Or at the fox which lives by subtilty
Or at the roe which no encounter dare        676
Pursue these fearful creatures oer the downs
And on thy wellbreathd horse keep with thy hounds

And when thou hast on foot the purblind hare
Mark the poor wretch to overshoot his troubles   680
How he outruns the wind and with what care
He cranks and crosses with a thousand doubles
The many musits through the which he goes
Are like a labyrinth to amaze his foes      684

Sometime he runs among a flock of sheep
To make the cunning hounds mistake their smell
And sometime where earthdelving conies keep
To stop the loud pursuers in their yell       688
And sometime sorteth with a herd of deer
Danger deviseth shifts wit waits on fear

For there his smell with others being mingled   691
The hot scentsnuffing hounds are driven to doubt
Ceasing their clamorous cry till they have singled
With much ado the cold fault cleanly out
Then do they spend their mouths echo replies
As if another chase were in the skies       696

By this poor Wat far off upon a hill
Stands on his hinder legs with listning ear
To hearken if his foes pursue him still
Anon their loud alarums he doth hear        700
And now his grief may be compared well
To one sore sick that hears the passing bell

Then shalt thou see the dewbedabbled wretch
Turn and return indenting with the way      704
Each envious briar his weary legs do scratch
Each shadow makes him stop each murmur stay
For misery is trodden on by many
And being low never relievd by any        708

Lie quietly and hear a little more
Nay do not struggle for thou shalt not rise
To make thee hate the hunting of the boar
Unlike myself thou hearst me moralize       712
Applying this to that and so to so
For love can comment upon every woe

Where did I leave No matter where quoth he
Leave me and then the story aptly ends      716
The night is spent Why what of that quoth she
I am quoth he expected of my friends
And now tis dark and going I shall fall
In night quoth she desire sees best of all 720

But if thou fall oh then imagine this
The earth in love with thee thy footing trips
And all is but to rob thee of a kiss        723
Rich preys make true men thieves so do thy lips
Make modest Dian cloudy and forlorn
Lest she should steal a kiss and die forsworn

Now of this dark night I perceive the reason
Cynthia for shame obscures her silver shine     728
Till forging nature be condemnd of treason
For stealing moulds from heaven that were divine
Wherein she framd thee in high heavens despite
To shame the sun by day and her by night     732

And therefore hath she bribd the destinies
To cross the curious workmanship of nature
To mingle beauty with infirmities
And pure perfection with impure defeature      736
Making it subject to the tyranny
Of mad mischances and much misery

As burning fevers agues pale and faint
Lifepoisoning pestilence and frenzies wood     740
The marroweating sickness whose attaint
Disorder breeds by heating of the blood
Surfeits imposthumes grief and damnd despair
Swear natures death for framing thee so fair  744

And not the least of all these maladies
But in one minutes fight brings beauty under
Both favour savour hue and qualities
Whereat thimpartial gazer late did wonder     748
Are on the sudden wasted thawd and done
As mountain snow melts with the midday sun

Therefore despite of fruitless chastity
Lovelacking vestals and selfloving nuns      752
That on the earth would breed a scarcity
And barren dearth of daughters and of sons
Be prodigal the lamp that burns by night
Dries up his oil to lend the world his light   756

What is thy body but a swallowing grave
Seeming to bury that posterity
Which by the rights of time thou needs must have
If thou destroy them not in dark obscurity     760
If so the world will hold thee in disdain
Sith in thy pride so fair a hope is slain

So in thyself thyself art made away
A mischief worse than civil homebred strife    764
Or theirs whose desperate hands themselves do slay
Or butcher sire that reeves his son of life
Foul cankring rust the hidden treasure frets
But gold thats put to use more gold begets   768

Nay then quoth Adon you will fall again
Into your idle overhandled theme
The kiss I gave you is bestowd in vain
And all in vain you strive against the stream    772
For by this blackfacd night desires foul nurse
Your treatise makes me like you worse and worse

If love have lent you twenty thousand tongues
And every tongue more moving than your own     776
Bewitching like the wanton mermaids songs
Yet from mine ear the tempting tune is blown
For know my heart stands armed in mine ear
And will not let a false sound enter there    780

Lest the deceiving harmony should run
Into the quiet closure of my breast
And then my little heart were quite undone
In his bedchamber to be barrd of rest       784
No lady no my heart longs not to groan
But soundly sleeps while now it sleeps alone

What have you urgd that I cannot reprove
The path is smooth that leadeth on to danger    790
I hate not love but your device in love
That lends embracements unto every stranger
You do it for increase O strange excuse
When reason is the bawd to lusts abuse      792

Call it not love for love to heaven is fled
Since sweating lust on earth usurpd his name
Under whose simple semblance he hath fed
Upon fresh beauty blotting it with blame      796
Which the hot tyrant stains and soon bereaves
As caterpillars do the tender leaves

Love comforteth like sunshine after rain
But lusts effect is tempest after sun       800
Loves gentle spring doth always fresh remain
Lusts winter comes ere summer half be done
Love surfeits not lust like a glutton dies
Love is all truth lust full of forged lies    804

More I could tell but more I dare not say
The text is old the orator too green
Therefore in sadness now I will away
My face is full of shame my heart of teen     808
Mine ears that to your wanton talk attended
Do burn themselves for having so offended

With this he breaketh from the sweet embrace     811
Of those fair arms which bound him to her breast
And homeward through the dark laund runs apace
Leaves love upon her back deeply distressd
Look how a bright star shooteth from the sky
So glides he in the night from Venus eye     816

Which after him she darts as one on shore
Gazing upon a late embarked friend
Till the wild waves will have him seen no more
Whose ridges with the meeting clouds contend    820
So did the merciless and pitchy night
Fold in the object that did feed her sight

Whereat amazd as one that unaware
Hath droppd a precious jewel in the flood     824
Or stonishd as nightwanderers often are
Their light blown out in some mistrustful wood
Even so confounded in the dark she lay
Having lost the fair discovery of her way     828

And now she beats her heart whereat it groans
That all the neighbour caves as seeming troubled
Make verbal repetition of her moans
Passion on passion deeply is redoubled       832
Ay me she cries and twenty times Woe woe
And twenty echoes twenty times cry so

She marking them begins a wailing note
And sings extemporally a woeful ditty        836
How love makes young men thrall and old men dote
How love is wise in folly foolish witty
Her heavy anthem still concludes in woe
And still the choir of echoes answer so      840

Her song was tedious and outwore the night
For lovers hours are long though seeming short
If pleasd themselves others they think delight
In such like circumstance with such like sport   844
Their copious stories oftentimes begun
End without audience and are never done

For who hath she to spend the night withal
But idle sounds resembling parasites        848
Like shrilltongud tapsters answering every call
Soothing the humour of fantastic wits
She says Tis so they answer all Tis so
And would say after her if she said No     852

Lo here the gentle lark weary of rest
From his moist cabinet mounts up on high
And wakes the morning from whose silver breast
The sun ariseth in his majesty           856
Who doth the world so gloriously behold
That cedar tops and hills seem burnishd gold

Venus salutes him with this fair good morrow
Oh thou clear god and patron of all light     860
From whom each lamp and shining star doth borrow
The beauteous influence that makes him bright
There lives a son that suckd an earthly mother
May lend thee light as thou dost lend to other

This said she hasteth to a myrtle grove      865
Musing the morning is so much oerworn
And yet she hears no tidings of her love
She hearkens for his hounds and for his horn    868
Anon she hears them chant it lustily
And all in haste she coasteth to the cry

And as she runs the bushes in the way
Some catch her by the neck some kiss her face   872
Some twine about her thigh to make her stay
She wildly breaketh from their strict embrace
Like a milch doe whose swelling dugs do ache
Hasting to feed her fawn hid in some brake    876

By this she hears the hounds are at a bay
Whereat she starts like one that spies an adder
Wreathd up in fatal folds just in his way
The fear whereof doth make him shake and shudder  880
Even so the timorous yelping of the hounds
Appals her senses and her spirit confounds

For now she knows it is no gentle chase
But the blunt boar rough bear or lion proud    884
Because the cry remaineth in one place
Where fearfully the dogs exclaim aloud
Finding their enemy to be so curst
They all strain courtsy who shall cope him first 888

This dismal cry rings sadly in her ear
Through which it enters to surprise her heart
Who overcome by doubt and bloodless fear
With coldpale weakness numbs each feeling part   892
Like soldiers when their captain once doth yield
They basely fly and dare not stay the field

Thus stands she in a trembling ecstasy
Till cheering up her senses sore dismayd      896
She tells them tis a causeless fantasy
And childish error that they are afraid
Bids them leave quaking bids them fear no more
And with that word she spied the hunted boar   900

Whose frothy mouth bepainted all with red
Like milk and blood being mingled both together
A second fear through all her sinews spread
Which madly hurries her she knows not whither    904
This way she runs and now she will no further
But back retires to rate the boar for murther

A thousand spleens bear her a thousand ways
She treads the path that she untreads again     908
Her more than haste is mated with delays
Like the proceedings of a drunken brain
Full of respects yet naught at all respecting
In hand with all things naught at all effecting

Here kenneld in a brake she finds a hound     913
And asks the weary caitiff for his master
And there another licking of his wound
Gainst venomd sores the only sovereign plaster  916
And here she meets another sadly scowling
To whom she speaks and he replies with howling

When he hath ceasd his illresounding noise
Another flapmouthd mourner black and grim    920
Against the welkin volleys out his voice
Another and another answer him
Clapping their proud tails to the ground below
Shaking their scratchd ears bleeding as they go

Look how the worlds poor people are amazed     925
At apparitions signs and prodigies
Whereon with fearful eyes they long have gazed
Infusing them with dreadful prophecies       928
So she at these sad sighs draws up her breath
And sighing it again exclaims on death

Hardfavourd tyrant ugly meagre lean      931
Hateful divorce of love thus chides she death
Grimgrinning ghost earths worm what dost thou mean
To stifle beauty and to steal his breath
Who when he livd his breath and beauty set
Gloss on the rose smell to the violet      936

If he be dead O no it cannot be
Seeing his beauty thou shouldst strike at it
O yes it may thou hast no eyes to see
But hatefully at random dost thou hit        940
Thy mark is feeble age but thy false dart
Mistakes that aim and cleaves an infants heart

Hadst thou but bid beware then he had spoke
And hearing him thy power had lost his power    944
The destinies will curse thee for this stroke
They bid thee crop a weed thou pluckst a flower
Loves golden arrow at him should have fled
And not deaths ebon dart to strike him dead   948

Dost thou drink tears that thou provokst such weeping
What may a heavy groan advantage thee
Why hast thou cast into eternal sleeping
Those eyes that taught all other eyes to see    952
Now nature cares not for thy mortal vigour
Since her best work is ruind with thy rigour

Here overcome as one full of despair
She vaild her eyelids who like sluices stoppd   956
The crystal tide that from her two cheeks fair
In the sweet channel of her bosom droppd
But through the floodgates breaks the silver rain
And with his strong course opens them again    960

O how her eyes and tears did lend and borrow
Her eyes seen in the tears tears in her eye
Both crystals where they viewd each others sorrow
Sorrow that friendly sighs sought still to dry   964
But like a stormy day now wind now rain
Sighs dry her cheeks tears make them wet again

Variable passions throng her constant woe
As striving who should best become her grief    968
All entertaind each passion labours so
That every present sorrow seemeth chief
But none is best then join they all together
Like many clouds consulting for foul weather   972

By this far off she hears some huntsman holla
A nurses song neer pleasd her babe so well
The dire imagination she did follow
This sound of hope doth labour to expel       976
For now reviving joy bids her rejoice
And flatters her it is Adonis voice

Whereat her tears began to turn their tide
Being prisond in her eye like pearls in glass   980
Yet sometimes falls an orient drop beside
Which her cheek melts as scorning it should pass
To wash the foul face of the sluttish ground
Who is but drunken when she seemeth drownd

O hardbelieving love how strange it seems     985
Not to believe and yet too credulous
Thy weal and woe are both of them extremes
Despair and hope make thee ridiculous        988
The one doth flatter thee in thoughts unlikely
In likely thoughts the other kills thee quickly

Now she unweaves the web that she hath wrought
Adonis lives and death is not to blame       992
It was not she that calld him all to naught
Now she adds honours to his hateful name
She clepes him king of graves and grave for kings
Imperious supreme of all mortal things      996

No no quoth she sweet death I did but jest
Yet pardon me I felt a kind of fear
Whenas I met the boar that bloody beast
Which knows no pity but is still severe      1000
Then gentle shadowtruth I must confess
I raild on thee fearing my loves decease

Tis not my fault the boar provokd my tongue
Be wreakd on him invisible commander       1004
Tis he foul creature that hath done thee wrong
I did but act hes author of my slander
Grief hath two tongues and never woman yet
Could rule them both without ten womens wit

Thus hoping that Adonis is alive          1009
Her rash suspect she doth extenuate
And that his beauty may the better thrive
With death she humbly doth insinuate        1012
Tells him of trophies statues tombs and stories
His victories his triumphs and his glories

O love quoth she how much a fool was I
To be of such a weak and silly mind        1016
To wail his death who lives and must not die
Till mutual overthrow of mortal kind
For he being dead with him is beauty slain
And beauty dead black Chaos comes again     1020

Fie fie fond love thou art as full of fear
As one with treasure laden hemmd with thieves
Trifles unwitnessed with eye or ear
Thy coward heart with false bethinking grieves  1024
Even at this word she hears a merry horn
Whereat she leaps that was but late forlorn

As falcon to the lure away she flies
The grass stoops not she treads on it so light  1028
And in her haste unfortunately spies
The foul boars conquest on her fair delight
Which seen her eyes as murderd with the view
Like stars ashamd of day themselves withdrew

Or as the snail whose tender horns being hit   1033
Shrinks backwards in his shelly cave with pain
And there all smotherd up in shade doth sit
Long after fearing to creep forth again      1036
So at his bloody view her eyes are fled
Into the deep dark cabins of her head

Where they resign their office and their light
To the disposing of her troubled brain       1040
Who bids them still consort with ugly night
And never wound the heart with looks again
Who like a king perplexed in his throne
By their suggestion gives a deadly groan     1044

Whereat each tributary subject quakes
As when the wind imprisond in the ground
Struggling for passage earths foundation shakes
Which with cold terror doth mens minds confound
This mutiny each part doth so surprise      1049
That from their dark beds once more leap her eyes

And being opend threw unwilling light
Upon the wide wound that the boar had trenchd
In his soft flank whose wonted lily white     1053
With purple tears that his wound wept was drenchd
No flower was nigh no grass herb leaf or weed
But stole his blood and seemd with him to bleed

This solemn sympathy poor Venus noteth       1057
Over one shoulder doth she hang her head
Dumbly she passions franticly she doteth
She thinks he could not die he is not dead    1060
Her voice is stoppd her joints forget to bow
Her eyes are mad that they have wept till now

Upon his hurt she looks so steadfastly
That her sight dazzling makes the wound seem three
And then she reprehends her mangling eye      1065
That makes more gashes where no breach should be
His face seems twain each several limb is doubled
For oft the eye mistakes the brain being troubled

My tongue cannot express my grief for one     1069
And yet quoth she behold two Adons dead
My sighs are blown away my salt tears gone
Mine eyes are turnd to fire my heart to lead   1072
Heavy hearts lead melt at mine eyes red fire
So shall I die by drops of hot desire

Alas poor world what treasure hast thou lost
What face remains alive thats worth the viewing
Whose tongue is music now what canst thou boast
Of things long since or anything ensuing     1078
The flowers are sweet their colours fresh and trim
But true sweet beauty livd and died with him

Bonnet nor veil henceforth no creature wear    1081
Nor sun nor wind will ever strive to kiss you
Having no fair to lose you need not fear
The sun doth scorn you and the wind doth hiss you
But when Adonis livd sun and sharp air     1085
Lurkd like two thieves to rob him of his fair

And therefore would he put his bonnet on
Under whose brim the gaudy sun would peep     1088
The wind would blow it off and being gone
Play with his locks then would Adonis weep
And straight in pity of his tender years
They both would strive who first should dry his tears

To see his face the lion walkd along       1093
Behind some hedge because he would not fear him
To recreate himself when he hath sung
The tiger would be tame and gently hear him    1096
If he had spoke the wolf would leave his prey
And never fright the silly lamb that day

When he beheld his shadow in the brook
The fishes spread on it their golden gills     1100
When he was by the birds such pleasure took
That some would sing some other in their bills
Would bring him mulberries and ripered cherries
He fed them with his sight they him with berries

But this foul grim and urchinsnouted boar   1105
Whose downward eye still looketh for a grave
Neer saw the beauteous livery that he wore
Witness the entertainment that he gave       1108
If he did see his face why then I know
He thought to kiss him and hath killd him so

Tis true tis true thus was Adonis slain
He ran upon the boar with his sharp spear     1112
Who did not whet his teeth at him again
But by a kiss thought to persuade him there
And nuzzling in his flank the loving swine
Sheathd unaware the tusk in his soft groin   1116

Had I been toothd like him I must confess
With kissing him I should have killd him first
But he is dead and never did he bless
My youth with his the more am I accurst     1120
With this she falleth in the place she stood
And stains her face with his congealed blood

She looks upon his lips and they are pale
She takes him by the hand and that is cold    1124
She whispers in his ears a heavy tale
As if they heard the woeful words she told
She lifts the cofferlids that close his eyes
Where lo two lamps burnt out in darkness lies

Two glasses where herself herself beheld      1129
A thousand times and now no more reflect
Their virtue lost wherein they late excelld
And every beauty robbd of his effect       1132
Wonder of time quoth she this is my spite
That thou being dead the day should yet be light

Since thou art dead lo here I prophesy
Sorrow on love hereafter shall attend       1136
It shall be waited on with jealousy
Find sweet beginning but unsavoury end
Neer settled equally but high or low
That all loves pleasure shall not match his woe

It shall be fickle false and full of fraud    1141
Bud and be blasted in a breathing while
The bottom poison and the top oerstrawd
With sweets that shall the truest sight beguile  1144
The strongest body shall it make most weak
Strike the wise dumb and teach the fool to speak

It shall be sparing and too full of riot
Teaching decrepit age to tread the measures    1148
The staring ruffian shall it keep in quiet
Pluck down the rich enrich the poor with treasures
It shall be raging mad and silly mild
Make the young old the old become a child    1152

It shall suspect where is no cause of fear
It shall not fear where it should most mistrust
It shall be merciful and too severe
And most deceiving when it seems most just     1156
Perverse it shall be where it shows most toward
Put fear to valour courage to the coward

It shall be cause of war and dire events
And set dissension twixt the son and sire     1160
Subject and servile to all discontents
As dry combustious matter is to fire
Sith in his prime death doth my love destroy
They that love best their love shall not enjoy 1164

By this the boy that by her side lay killd
Was melted like a vapour from her sight
And in his blood that on the ground lay spilld
A purple flower sprung up chequerd with white  1168
Resembling well his pale cheeks and the blood
Which in round drops upon their whiteness stood

She bows her head the newsprung flower to smell
Comparing it to her Adonis breath         1172
And says within her bosom it shall dwell
Since he himself is reft from her by death
She drops the stalk and in the breach appears
Greendropping sap which she compares to tears

Poor flower quoth she this was thy fathers guise
Sweet issue of a more sweetsmelling sire
For every little grief to wet his eyes
To grow unto himself was his desire        1180
And so tis thine but know it is as good
To wither in my breast as in his blood

Here was thy fathers bed here in my breast
Thou art the next of blood and tis thy right   1184
Lo in this hollow cradle take thy rest
My throbbing heart shall rock thee day and night
There shall not be one minute in an hour
Wherein I will not kiss my sweet loves flower

Thus weary of the world away she hies       1189
And yokes her silver doves by whose swift aid
Their mistress mounted through the empty skies
In her light chariot quickly is conveyd      1192
Holding their course to Paphos where their queen
Means to immure herself and not be seen
