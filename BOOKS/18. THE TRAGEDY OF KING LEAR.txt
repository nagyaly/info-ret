ACT I

SCENE I A Room of State in King Lears Palace


Enter Kent Gloucester and Edmund

KENT
I thought the King had more affected the Duke of Albany than Cornwall

GLOUCESTER
It did always seem so to us but now in the division of the kingdom
it appears not which of the Dukes he values most for qualities are so
weighed that curiosity in neither can make choice of eithers moiety

KENT
Is not this your son my lord

GLOUCESTER
His breeding sir hath been at my charge I have so often
blushd to acknowledge him that now I am brazd tot

KENT
I cannot conceive you

GLOUCESTER
Sir this young fellows mother could whereupon she grew
roundwombed and had indeed sir a son for her cradle ere she
had a husband for her bed Do you smell a fault

KENT
I cannot wish the fault undone the issue of it being so proper

GLOUCESTER
But I have a son sir by order of law some year elder than
this who yet is no dearer in my account though this knave came
something saucily to the world before he was sent for yet was
his mother fair there was good sport at his making and the
whoreson must be acknowledged Do you know this noble gentleman
Edmund

EDMUND
No my lord

GLOUCESTER
My Lord of Kent remember him hereafter as my honourable friend

EDMUND
My services to your lordship

KENT
I must love you and sue to know you better

EDMUND
Sir I shall study deserving

GLOUCESTER
He hath been out nine years and away he shall again The King
is coming

Enter Lear Cornwall Albany Goneril Regan Cordelia and Attendants

LEAR
Attend the lords of France and Burgundy
Gloucester

GLOUCESTER
I shall my lord

Exeunt Gloucester and Edmund

LEAR
Meantime we shall express our darker purpose
Give me the map there Know that we have divided
In three our kingdom and tis our fast intent
To shake all cares and business from our age
Conferring them on younger strengths while we
Unburdend crawl toward death Our son of Cornwall
And you our no less loving son of Albany
We have this hour a constant will to publish
Our daughters several dowers that future strife
May be prevented now The princes France and Burgundy
Great rivals in our youngest daughters love
Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn
And here are to be answerd Tell me my daughters
Since now we will divest us both of rule
Interest of territory cares of state
Which of you shall we say doth love us most
That we our largest bounty may extend
Where nature doth with merit challengeGoneril
Our eldest born speak first

GONERIL
Sir I love you more than word can wield the matter
Dearer than eyesight space and liberty
Beyond what can be valud rich or rare
No less than life with grace health beauty honour
As much as child eer lovd or father found
A love that makes breath poor and speech unable
Beyond all manner of so much I love you

CORDELIA
Aside What shall Cordelia speak Love and be silent

LEAR
Of all these bounds even from this line to this
With shadowy forests and with champains richd
With plenteous rivers and wideskirted meads
We make thee lady to thine and Albanys issue
Be this perpetualWhat says our second daughter
Our dearest Regan wife of Cornwall Speak

REGAN
Sir I am made of the self mettle as my sister
And prize me at her worth In my true heart
I find she names my very deed of love
Only she comes too short that I profess
Myself an enemy to all other joys
Which the most precious square of sense possesses
And find I am alone felicitate
In your dear highness love

CORDELIA
Aside Then poor Cordelia
And yet not so since I am sure my loves
More ponderous than my tongue

LEAR
To thee and thine hereditary ever
Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom
No less in space validity and pleasure
Than that conferrd on GonerilNow our joy
Although the last and least to whose young love
The vines of France and milk of Burgundy
Strive to be interessd what can you say to draw
A third more opulent than your sisters Speak

CORDELIA
Nothing my lord

LEAR
Nothing

CORDELIA
Nothing

LEAR
Nothing will come of nothing speak again

CORDELIA
Unhappy that I am I cannot heave
My heart into my mouth I love your majesty
According to my bond no more nor less

LEAR
How how Cordelia Mend your speech a little
Lest you may mar your fortunes

CORDELIA
Good my lord
You have begot me bred me lovd me I
Return those duties back as are right fit
Obey you love you and most honour you
Why have my sisters husbands if they say
They love you all Haply when I shall wed
That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry
Half my love with him half my care and duty
Sure I shall never marry like my sisters
To love my father all

LEAR
But goes thy heart with this

CORDELIA
Ay my good lord

LEAR
So young and so untender

CORDELIA
So young my lord and true

LEAR
Let it be so thy truth then be thy dower
For by the sacred radiance of the sun
The mysteries of Hecate and the night
By all the operation of the orbs
From whom we do exist and cease to be
Here I disclaim all my paternal care
Propinquity and property of blood
And as a stranger to my heart and me
Hold thee from this for ever The barbarous Scythian
Or he that makes his generation messes
To gorge his appetite shall to my bosom
Be as well neighbourd pitied and relievd
As thou my sometime daughter

KENT
Good my liege

LEAR
Peace Kent
Come not between the dragon and his wrath
I lovd her most and thought to set my rest
On her kind nursery To Cordelia Hence and avoid my sight
So be my grave my peace as here I give
Her fathers heart from her Call France Who stirs
Call Burgundy Cornwall and Albany
With my two daughters dowers digest this third
Let pride which she calls plainness marry her
I do invest you jointly with my power
Preeminence and all the large effects
That troop with majesty Ourself by monthly course
With reservation of an hundred knights
By you to be sustaind shall our abode
Make with you by due turn Only we shall retain
The name and all the addition to a king the sway
Revenue execution of the rest
Beloved sons be yours which to confirm
This coronet part between you
Giving the crown

KENT
Royal Lear
Whom I have ever honourd as my king
Lovd as my father as my master followd
As my great patron thought on in my prayers

LEAR
The bow is bent and drawn make from the shaft

KENT
Let it fall rather though the fork invade
The region of my heart be Kent unmannerly
When Lear is mad What wouldst thou do old man
Thinkst thou that duty shall have dread to speak
When power to flattery bows To plainness honours bound
When majesty falls to folly Reverse thy state
And in thy best consideration check
This hideous rashness answer my life my judgement
Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least
Nor are those emptyhearted whose low sounds
Reverb no hollowness

LEAR
Kent on thy life no more

KENT
My life I never held but as a pawn
To wage against thine enemies neer fear to lose it
Thy safety being the motive

LEAR
Out of my sight

KENT
See better Lear and let me still remain
The true blank of thine eye

LEAR
Now by Apollo

KENT
Now by Apollo King
Thou swearst thy gods in vain

LEAR
O vassal Miscreant

Laying his hand on his sword

ALBANY and CORNWALL
Dear sir forbear

KENT
Kill thy physician and the fee bestow
Upon the foul disease Revoke thy gift
Or whilst I can vent clamour from my throat
Ill tell thee thou dost evil

LEAR
Hear me recreant on thine allegiance hear me
Since thou hast sought to make us break our vows
Which we durst never yet and with straind pride
To come betwixt our sentences and our power
Which nor our nature nor our place can bear
Our potency made good take thy reward
Five days we do allot thee for provision
To shield thee from disasters of the world
And on the sixth to turn thy hated back
Upon our kingdom if on the next day following
Thy banishd trunk be found in our dominions
The moment is thy death Away By Jupiter
This shall not be revokd

KENT
Fare thee well King sith thus thou wilt appear
Freedom lives hence and banishment is here
To Cordelia The gods to their dear shelter take thee maid
That justly thinkst and hast most rightly said
To Goneril and Regan And your large speeches may your deeds
approve
That good effects may spring from words of love
Thus Kent O princes bids you all adieu
Hell shape his old course in a country new

Exit

Flourish Reenter Gloucester with France Burgundy and Attendants

CORDELIA
Heres France and Burgundy my noble lord

LEAR
My Lord of Burgundy
We first address toward you who with this king
Hath rivalld for our daughter what in the least
Will you require in present dower with her
Or cease your quest of love

BURGUNDY
Most royal majesty
I crave no more than hath your highness offerd
Nor will you tender less

LEAR
Right noble Burgundy
When she was dear to us we did hold her so
But now her price is falln Sir there she stands
If aught within that littleseeming substance
Or all of it with our displeasure piecd
And nothing more may fitly like your grace
Shes there and she is yours

BURGUNDY
I know no answer

LEAR
Will you with those infirmities she owes
Unfriended new adopted to our hate
Dowerd with our curse and strangerd with our oath
Take her or leave her

BURGUNDY
Pardon me royal sir
Election makes not up in such conditions

LEAR
Then leave her sir for by the power that made me
I tell you all her wealth To France For you great king
I would not from your love make such a stray
To match you where I hate therefore beseech you
Tavert your liking a more worthier way
Than on a wretch whom nature is ashamd
Almost tacknowledge hers

FRANCE
This is most strange
That she who even but now was your best object
The argument of your praise balm of your age
The best the dearest should in this trice of time
Commit a thing so monstrous to dismantle
So many folds of favour Sure her offence
Must be of such unnatural degree
That monsters it or your forevouchd affection
Fall into taint which to believe of her
Must be a faith that reason without miracle
Should never plant in me

CORDELIA
I yet beseech your majesty
If for I want that glib and oily art
To speak and purpose not since what I well intend
Ill dot before I speakthat you make known
It is no vicious blot murder or foulness
No unchaste action or dishonourd step
That hath deprivd me of your grace and favour
But even for want of that for which I am richer
A still soliciting eye and such a tongue
As I am glad I have not though not to have it
Hath lost me in your liking

LEAR
Better thou hadst
Not been born than not to have pleasd me better

FRANCE
Is it but thisa tardiness in nature
Which often leaves the history unspoke
That it intends to do My lord of Burgundy
What say you to the lady Loves not love
When it is mingled with regards that stands
Aloof from the entire point Will you have her
She is herself a dowry

BURGUNDY
Royal King
Give but that portion which yourself proposd
And here I take Cordelia by the hand
Duchess of Burgundy

LEAR
Nothing I have sworn I am firm

BURGUNDY
I am sorry then you have so lost a father
That you must lose a husband

CORDELIA
Peace be with Burgundy
Since that respects of fortunes are his love
I shall not be his wife

FRANCE
Fairest Cordelia that art most rich being poor
Most choice forsaken and most lovd despisd
Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon
Be it lawful I take up whats cast away
Gods gods Tis strange that from their coldst neglect
My love should kindle to inflamd respect
Thy dowerless daughter King thrown to my chance
Is queen of us of ours and our fair France
Not all the dukes of waterish Burgundy
Can buy this unprizd precious maid of me
Bid them farewell Cordelia though unkind
Thou losest here a better where to find

LEAR
Thou hast her France let her be thine for we
Have no such daughter nor shall ever see
That face of hers again Therefore be gone
Without our grace our love our benison
Come noble Burgundy

Flourish Exeunt Lear Burgundy Cornwall Albany Gloucester and
Attendants

FRANCE
Bid farewell to your sisters

CORDELIA
The jewels of our father with washd eyes
Cordelia leaves you I know you what you are
And like a sister am most loath to call
Your faults as they are namd Love well our father
To your professed bosoms I commit him
But yet alas stood I within his grace
I would prefer him to a better place
So farewell to you both

REGAN
Prescribe not us our duties

GONERIL
Let your study
Be to content your lord who hath receivd you
At fortunes alms You have obedience scanted
And well are worth the want that you have wanted

CORDELIA
Time shall unfold what plighted cunning hides
Who covers faults at last shame derides
Well may you prosper

FRANCE
Come my fair Cordelia

Exeunt France and Cordelia

GONERIL
Sister it is not little I have to say of what most nearly
appertains to us both I think our father will hence tonight

REGAN
Thats most certain and with you next month with us

GONERIL
You see how full of changes his age is the observation we
have made of it hath not been little he always loved our
sister most and with what poor judgement he hath now cast her
off appears too grossly

REGAN
Tis the infirmity of his age yet he hath ever but slenderly
known himself

GONERIL
The best and soundest of his time hath been but rash then must
we look from his age to receive not alone the imperfections of
longengrafted condition but therewithal the unruly waywardness
that infirm and choleric years bring with them

REGAN
Such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as this of Kents
banishment

GONERIL
There is further compliment of leavetaking between France and
him Pray you let us hit together if our father carry authority
with such disposition as he bears this last surrender of his
will but offend us

REGAN
We shall further think of it

GONERIL
We must do something and i th heat

Exeunt

SCENE II A Hall in the Earl of Gloucesters Castle

Enter Edmund with a
letter

EDMUND
Thou Nature art my goddess to thy law
My services are bound Wherefore should I
Stand in the plague of custom and permit
The curiosity of nations to deprive me
For that I am some twelve or fourteen moonshines
Lag of a brother Why bastard Wherefore base
When my dimensions are as well compact
My mind as generous and my shape as true
As honest madams issue Why brand they us
With base With baseness bastardy Base base
Who in the lusty stealth of nature take
More composition and fierce quality
Than doth within a dull stale tired bed
Go to the creating a whole tribe of fops
Got tween asleep and wake Well then
Legitimate Edgar I must have your land
Our fathers love is to the bastard Edmund
As to the legitimate fine word legitimate
Well my legitimate if this letter speed
And my invention thrive Edmund the base
Shall top the legitimate I grow I prosper
Now gods stand up for bastards

Enter Gloucester

GLOUCESTER
Kent banishd thus and France in choler parted
And the King gone tonight Prescribd his powr
Confind to exhibition All this done
Upon the gadEdmund how now What news

EDMUND
So please your lordship none

Putting up the letter

GLOUCESTER
Why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter

EDMUND
I know no news my lord

GLOUCESTER
What paper were you reading

EDMUND
Nothing my lord

GLOUCESTER
No What needed then that terrible dispatch of it into your pocket The
quality of nothing hath not such need to hide itself Lets see Come
if it be nothing I shall not need spectacles

EDMUND
I beseech you sir pardon me It is a letter from my brother that I
have not all oerread and for so much as I have perusd I find it
not fit for your oerlooking

GLOUCESTER
Give me the letter sir

EDMUND
I shall offend either to detain or give it The contents as in
part I understand them are to blame

GLOUCESTER
Lets see lets see

EDMUND
I hope for my brothers justification he wrote this but as an
essay or taste of my virtue

GLOUCESTER
Reads This policy and reverence of age makes the world
bitter to the best of our times keeps our fortunes from us
till our oldness cannot relish them I begin to find an idle
and fond bondage in the oppression of aged tyranny who sways
not as it hath power but as it is suffered Come to me that
of this I may speak more If our father would sleep till I
waked him you should enjoy half his revenue for ever and live
the beloved of your brother EDGAR
Hum Conspiracy Sleep till I wake him you should enjoy half
his revenueMy son Edgar Had he a hand to write this A heart
and brain to breed it in When came this to you Who brought it

EDMUND
It was not brought me my lord theres the cunning of it I
found it thrown in at the casement of my closet

GLOUCESTER
You know the character to be your brothers

EDMUND
If the matter were good my lord I durst swear it were his but
in respect of that I would fain think it were not

GLOUCESTER
It is his

EDMUND
It is his hand my lord but I hope his heart is not in the
contents

GLOUCESTER
Has he never before sounded you in this business

EDMUND
Never my lord But I have heard him oft maintain it to be fit
that sons at perfect age and fathers declined the father
should be as ward to the son and the son manage his revenue

GLOUCESTER
O villain villain His very opinion in the letter Abhorred
villain Unnatural detested brutish villain worse than
brutish Go sirrah seek him Ill apprehend him Abominable
villain Where is he

EDMUND
I do not well know my lord If it shall please you to suspend
your indignation against my brother till you can derive from him
better testimony of his intent you should run a certain course
where if you violently proceed against him mistaking his
purpose it would make a great gap in your own honour and shake
in pieces the heart of his obedience I dare pawn down my life
for him that he hath writ this to feel my affection to your
honour and to no other pretence of danger

GLOUCESTER
Think you so

EDMUND
If your honour judge it meet I will place you where you shall hear us
confer of this and by an auricular assurance have your satisfaction
and that without any further delay than this very evening

GLOUCESTER
He cannot be such a monster

EDMUND
Nor is not sure

GLOUCESTER
To his father that so tenderly and entirely loves him Heaven
and earth Edmund seek him out wind me into him I pray you
frame the business after your own wisdom I would unstate myself
to be in a due resolution

EDMUND
I will seek him sir presently convey the business as I shall
find means and acquaint you withal

GLOUCESTER
These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us
though the wisdom of Nature can reason it thus and thus yet
nature finds itself scourged by the sequent effects Love cools
friendship falls off brothers divide in cities mutinies in
countries discord in palaces treason and the bond cracked
twixt son and father This villain of mine comes under the
prediction theres son against father the King falls from
bias of nature theres father against child We have seen the
best of our time Machinations hollowness treachery and all
ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves Find out
this villain Edmund it shall lose thee nothing do it
carefullyAnd the noble and truehearted Kent banished his
offence honesty Tis strange

Exit

EDMUND
This is the excellent foppery of the world that when we are
sick in fortune often the surfeits of our own behaviour we
make guilty of our disasters the sun the moon and the stars as
if we were villains on necessity fools by heavenly compulsion
knaves thieves and treachers by spherical predominance
drunkards liars and adulterers by an enforced obedience of
planetary influence and all that we are evil in by a divine
thrusting on An admirable evasion of whoremaster man to lay his
goatish disposition to the charge of a star My father compounded
with my mother under the dragons tail and my nativity was under
Ursa Major so that it follows I am rough and lecherous Fut I
should have been that I am had the maidenliest star in the
firmament twinkled on my bastardizing

Enter Edgar

Pat he comes like the catastrophe of the old comedy my cue
is villainous melancholy with a sigh like Tom oBedlamO
these eclipses do portend these divisions Fa sol la mi

EDGAR
How now brother Edmund what serious contemplation are you in

EDMUND
I am thinking brother of a prediction I read this other day
what should follow these eclipses

EDGAR
Do you busy yourself with that

EDMUND
I promise you the effects he writes of succeed unhappily as of
unnaturalness between the child and the parent death dearth
dissolutions of ancient amities divisions in state menaces and
maledictions against King and nobles needless diffidences
banishment of friends dissipation of cohorts nuptial breaches
and I know not what

EDGAR
How long have you been a sectary astronomical

EDMUND
Come come when saw you my father last

EDGAR
The night gone by

EDMUND
Spake you with him

EDGAR
Ay two hours together

EDMUND
Parted you in good terms Found you no displeasure in him by word
nor countenance

EDGAR
None at all

EDMUND
Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended him and at my
entreaty forbear his presence until some little time hath
qualified the heat of his displeasure which at this instant so
rageth in him that with the mischief of your person it would
scarcely allay

EDGAR
Some villain hath done me wrong

EDMUND
Thats my fear I pray you have a continent forbearance till the
speed of his rage goes slower and as I say retire with me to
my lodging from whence I will fitly bring you to hear my lord
speak pray ye go theres my key If you do stir abroad go
armed

EDGAR
Armed brother

EDMUND
Brother I advise you to the best I am no honest man
if there be any good meaning toward you I have told you what I
have seen and heard But faintly nothing like the image and
horror of it pray you away

EDGAR
Shall I hear from you anon

EDMUND
I do serve you in this business

Exit Edgar

A credulous father and a brother noble
Whose nature is so far from doing harms
That he suspects none on whose foolish honesty
My practices ride easy I see the business
Let me if not by birth have lands by wit
All with mes meet that I can fashion fit

Exit

SCENE III A Room in the Duke of Albanys Palace

Enter Goneril and Oswald

GONERIL
Did my father strike my gentleman for chiding of his fool

OSWALD
Ay madam

GONERIL
By day and night he wrongs me every hour
He flashes into one gross crime or other
That sets us all at odds Ill not endure it
His knights grow riotous and himself upbraids us
On every trifle When he returns from hunting
I will not speak with him say I am sick
If you come slack of former services
You shall do well the fault of it Ill answer

Horns within

OSWALD
Hes coming madam I hear him

GONERIL
Put on what weary negligence you please
You and your fellows Id have it come to question
If he distaste it let him to our sister
Whose mind and mine I know in that are one
Not to be overruled Idle old man
That still would manage those authorities
That he hath given away Now by my life
Old fools are babes again and must be usd
With checks as flatteries when they are seen abusd
Remember what I have said

OSWALD
Very well madam

GONERIL
And let his knights have colder looks among you
What grows of it no matter advise your fellows so
I would breed from hence occasions and I shall
That I may speak Ill write straight to my sister
To hold my very course Prepare for dinner

Exeunt

SCENE IV A Hall in Albanys Palace

Enter Kent disguised

KENT
If but as well I other accents borrow
That can my speech defuse my good intent
May carry through itself to that full issue
For which I raisd my likeness Now banishd Kent
If thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemnd
So may it come thy master whom thou lovst
Shall find thee full of labours

Horns within Enter King
Lear Knights and Attendants

Exit an Attendant

How now what art thou

KENT
A man sir

LEAR
What dost thou profess What wouldst thou with us

KENT
I do profess to be no less than I seem to serve him truly that
will put me in trust to love him that is honest to converse
with him that is wise and says little to fear judgement to fight
when I cannot choose and to eat no fish

LEAR
What art thou

KENT
A very honesthearted fellow and as poor as the King

LEAR
If thou best as poor for a subject as hes for a king thou art
poor enough What wouldst thou

KENT
Service

LEAR
Who wouldst thou serve

KENT

LEAR

KNIGHT
My lord I know not what the matter is but to my judgement your
highness is not entertained with that ceremonious affection as

well in the general dependants as in the Duke himself also and
your daughter

LEAR
Ha sayst thou so

KNIGHT
I beseech you pardon me my lord if I be mistaken for my duty
cannot be silent when I think your highness wronged

LEAR
Thou but rememberest me of mine own conception I have perceived
a most faint neglect of late which I have rather blamed as mine
own jealous curiosity than as a very pretence and purpose of
unkindness I will look further intot But wheres my fool I
have not seen him this two days

the middle and gavst away both parts thou borst thine ass on
thy back oer the dirt thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown
when thou gavst thy golden one away If I speak like myself in
this let him be whipped that first finds it so
Singing
Fools had neer less grace in a year
For wise men are grown foppish
And know not how their wits to wear
Their manners are so apish

LEAR
When were you wont to be so full of songs sirrah

FOOL
I have used it nuncle eer since thou madst thy daughters thy
mothers for when thou gavst them the rod and putst down thine
own breeches
Singing
Then they for sudden joy did weep
And I for sorrow sung
That such a king should play bopeep
And go the fools among
Prythee nuncle keep a schoolmaster that can teach thy fool to
lie I would fain learn to lie

LEAR
An you lie sirrah well have you whipped

Yes forsooth I will hold my tongue So your face bids me though
you say nothing Mum mum
He that keeps nor crust nor crum
Weary of all shall want some
Pointing to Lear Thats a shealed peascod

GONERIL
Not only sir this your alllicensd fool
But other of your insolent retinue
Do hourly carp and quarrel breaking forth
In rank and nottobeendured riots Sir
I had thought by making this well known unto you
To have found a safe redress but now grow fearful
By what yourself too late have spoke and done
That you protect this course and put it on
By your allowance which if you should the fault
Would not scape censure nor the redresses sleep
Which in the tender of a wholesome weal
Might in their working do you that offence
Which else were shame that then necessity
Will call discreet proceeding

FOOL
For you know nuncle
The hedgesparrow fed the cuckoo so long
That its had it head bit off by it young
So out went the candle and we were left darkling

LEAR
Are you our daughter

GONERIL
Come sir
I would you would make use of that good wisdom
Whereof I know you are fraught and put away
These dispositions which of late transform you
From what you rightly are

FOOL
May not an ass know when the cart draws the horse Whoop Jug I
love thee

LEAR
Doth any here know me This is not Lear
Doth Lear walk thus speak thus Where are his eyes
Either his notion weakens his discernings
Are lethargied Ha waking Tis not so
Who is it that can tell me who I am

FOOL
Lears shadow

LEAR
I would learn that for by the marks of sovereignty knowledge and
reason I should be false persuaded I had daughters

FOOL
Which they will make an obedient father

LEAR
Your name fair gentlewoman

GONERIL
This admiration sir is much o the favour
Of other your new pranks I do beseech you
To understand my purposes aright
As you are old and reverend you should be wise
Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires
Men so disorderd so deboshd and bold
That this our court infected with their manners
Shows like a riotous inn Epicurism and lust
Makes it more like a tavern or a brothel
Than a gracd palace The shame itself doth speak
For instant remedy Be then desird
By her that else will take the thing she begs
A little to disquantity your train
And the remainder that shall still depend
To be such men as may besort your age
Which know themselves and you

LEAR
Darkness and devils
Saddle my horses call my train together
Degenerate bastard Ill not trouble thee
Yet have I left a daughter

GONERIL
You strike my people and your disorderd rabble
Make servants of their betters

Enter Albany

LEAR
Woe that too late repents
To Albany O sir are you come
Is it your will Speak sirPrepare my horses
Ingratitude thou marblehearted fiend
More hideous when thou showst thee in a child
Than the seamonster

ALBANY
Pray sir be patient

LEAR
to Goneril Detested kite thou liest
My train are men of choice and rarest parts
That all particulars of duty know
And in the most exact regard support
The worships of their name O most small fault
How ugly didst thou in Cordelia show
Which like an engine wrenchd my frame of nature
From the fixd place drew from my heart all love
And added to the gall O Lear Lear Lear
Striking his head Beat at this gate that let thy folly in
And thy dear judgement out Go go my people

ALBANY
My lord I am guiltless as I am ignorant
Of what hath moved you

LEAR
It may be so my lord
Hear nature hear dear goddess hear
Suspend thy purpose if thou didst intend
To make this creature fruitful
Into her womb convey sterility
Dry up in her the organs of increase
And from her derogate body never spring
A babe to honour her If she must teem
Create her child of spleen that it may live
And be a thwart disnaturd torment to her
Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth
With cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks
Turn all her mothers pains and benefits
To laughter and contempt that she may feel
How sharper than a serpents tooth it is
To have a thankless child Away away

Exit

ALBANY
Now gods that we adore whereof comes this

GONERIL
Never afflict yourself to know more of it
But let his disposition have that scope
That dotage gives it

Reenter Lear

LEAR
What fifty of my followers at a clap
Within a fortnight

ALBANY
Whats the matter sir

LEAR
Ill tell thee To Goneril Life and death I am
ashamd
That thou hast power to shake my manhood thus
That these hot tears which break from me perforce
Should make thee worth them Blasts and fogs upon thee
Thuntented woundings of a fathers curse
Pierce every sense about thee Old fond eyes
Beweep this cause again Ill pluck ye out
And cast you with the waters that you lose
To temper clay Ha Let it be so
I have another daughter
Who I am sure is kind and comfortable
When she shall hear this of thee with her nails
Shell flay thy wolvish visage Thou shalt find
That Ill resume the shape which thou dost think
I have cast off for ever

Exeunt Lear Kent and Attendants

GONERIL
Do you mark that

ALBANY
I cannot be so partial Goneril
To the great love I bear you

GONERIL
Pray you content What Oswald ho
To the Fool You sir more knave than fool after your master

FOOL
Nuncle Lear nuncle Lear tarry and take the fool with thee
A fox when one has caught her
And such a daughter
Should sure to the slaughter
If my cap would buy a halter
So the fool follows after

Exit

GONERIL
This man hath had good counselA hundred knights
Tis politic and safe to let him keep
At point a hundred knights yes that on every dream
Each buzz each fancy each complaint dislike
He may enguard his dotage with their powers
And hold our lives in mercy Oswald I say

ALBANY
Well you may fear too far

GONERIL
Safer than trust too far
Let me still take away the harms I fear
Not fear still to be taken I know his heart
What he hath utterd I have writ my sister
If she sustain him and his hundred knights
When I have showd thunfitness

Reenter Oswald

How now Oswald
What have you writ that letter to my sister

OSWALD
Ay madam

GONERIL
Take you some company and away to horse
Inform her full of my particular fear
And thereto add such reasons of your own
As may compact it more Get you gone
And hasten your return

Exit Oswald

No no my lord
This milky gentleness and course of yours
Though I condemn not yet under pardon
You are much more attaskd for want of wisdom
Than praisd for harmful mildness

ALBANY
How far your eyes may pierce I cannot tell
Striving to better oft we mar whats well

GONERIL
Nay then

ALBANY
Well well the event

whispered ones for they are yet but earkissing arguments

EDMUND

Which I must act Briefness and fortune work
Brother a word descend brother I say

Enter Edgar

My father watches O sir fly this place
Intelligence is given where you are hid

Have you not spoken gainst the Duke of Cornwall
Hes coming hither now i the night i the haste
And Regan with him have you nothing said
Upon his party gainst the Duke of Albany
Advise yourself

Enter Gloucester and
Servants with torches

GLOUCESTER
Now Edmund wheres the villain

EDMUND
Here stood he in the dark his sharp sword out
Mumbling of wicked charms conjuring the moon
To stand auspicious mistress

GLOUCESTER
But where is he

EDMUND
Look sir I bleed

GLOUCESTER
Where is the villain Edmund

EDMUND

GLOUCESTER
Pursue him ho Go after

Exeunt Servants

By no means what

EDMUND
Persuade me to the murder of your lordship
But that I told him the revenging gods
Gainst parricides did all their thunders bend
Spoke with how manifold and strong a bond
The child was bound to the father sir in fine
Seeing how loathly opposite I stood
To his unnatural purpose in fell motion
With his prepared sword he charges home
My unprovided body latchd mine arm
But when he saw my best alarumd spirits
Bold in the quarrels right rousd to thencounter
Or whether gasted by the noise I made
Full suddenly he fled

GLOUCESTER
Let him fly far
Not in this land shall he remain uncaught
And founddispatchd The noble Duke my master
My worthy arch and patron comes tonight
By his authority I will proclaim it
That he which finds him shall deserve our thanks
Bringing the murderous coward to the stake
He that conceals him death

EDMUND
When I dissuaded him from his intent
And found him pight to do it with curst speech
I threatend to discover him he replied
Thou unpossessing bastard dost thou think
If I would stand against thee would the reposal
Of any trust virtue or worth in thee
Make thy words faithd No what I should deny
As this I would ay though thou didst produce
My very character Id turn it all
To thy suggestion plot and damned practice
And thou must make a dullard of the world
If they not thought the profits of my death
Were very pregnant and potential spurs
To make thee seek it

GLOUCESTER
O strange and fastned villain
Would he deny his letter said he I never got him

Tucket within

Hark the Dukes trumpets I know not why he comes
All ports Ill bar the villain shall not scape
The Duke must grant me that besides his picture
I will send far and near that all the kingdom
May have due note of him and of my land
Loyal and natural boy Ill work the means
To make thee capable

Enter Cornwall Regan and

That if they come to sojourn at my house

Which are too intrince tunloose smooth every passion
That in the natures of their lords rebel
Bring oil to fire snow to their colder moods
Renege affirm and turn their halcyon beaks
With every gale and vary of their masters
Knowing naught like dogs but following
A plague upon your epileptic visage
Smile you my speeches as I were a fool
Goose if I had you upon Sarum plain
Id drive ye cackling home to Camelot

Why dost thou call him knave What is his fault

KENT
His countenance likes me not

CORNWALL
No more perchance does mine or his or hers

KENT
Sir tis my occupation to be plain
I have seen better faces in my time
Than stands on any shoulder that I see
Before me at this instant

CORNWALL
This is some fellow
Who having been praisd for bluntness doth affect
A saucy roughness and constrains the garb
Quite from his nature he cannot flatter he
An honest mind and plain he must speak truth
An they will take it so if not hes plain
These kind of knaves I know which in this plainness
Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends
Than twenty sillyducking observants
That stretch their duties nicely

KENT
Sir in good faith in sincere verity
Under thallowance of your great aspect
Whose influence like the wreath of radiant fire
On flickering Phoebus front

CORNWALL
What meanst by this

KENT
To go out of my dialect which you discommend so much I know
sir I am no flatterer he that beguiled you in a plain accent
was a plain knave which for my part I will not be though I
should win your displeasure to entreat me tot

CORNWALL
What was the offence you gave him

OSWALD
I never gave him any
It pleasd the King his master very late
To strike at me upon his misconstruction
When he compact and flattering his displeasure
Trippd me behind being down insulted raild
And put upon him such a deal of man
That worthied him got praises of the King
For him attempting who was selfsubdud
And in the fleshment of this dread exploit
Drew on me here again

KENT
None of these rogues and cowards
But Ajax is their fool

CORNWALL
Fetch forth the stocks
You stubborn ancient knave you reverent braggart
Well teach you

KENT
Sir I am too old to learn
Call not your stocks for me I serve the King
On whose employment I was sent to you
You shall do small respect show too bold malice
Against the grace and person of my master
Stocking his messenger

CORNWALL
Fetch forth the stocks
As I have life and honour there shall he sit till noon

REGAN
Till noon Till night my lord and all night too

KENT
Why madam if I were your fathers dog

REGAN

Stocks brought out

CORNWALL
This is a fellow of the selfsame colour
Our sister speaks of Come bring away the stocks

GLOUCESTER
Let me beseech your grace not to do so
His fault is much and the good King his master
Will check him fort your purposd low correction
Is such as basest and contemnedst wretches
For pilferings and most common trespasses
Are punishd with The King must take it ill
That he so slightly valued in his messenger
Should have him thus restrained

CORNWALL
Ill answer that

REGAN
My sister may receive it much more worse
To have her gentleman abusd assaulted
For following her affairs Put in his legs

Kent is put in the
stocks

CORNWALL
Come my good lord away

Exeunt all but Gloucester and Kent

Whose disposition all the world well knows

KENT

A good mans fortune may grow out at heels
Give you good morrow

GLOUCESTER
The Dukes to blame in this twill be ill taken

Exit

KENT
Good King that must approve the common saw
Thou out of heavens benediction comst
To the warm sun
Approach thou beacon to this under globe
That by thy comfortable beams I may
Peruse this letter Nothing almost sees miracles
But misery I know tis from Cordelia
Who hath most fortunately been informd
Of my obscured course And shall find time
From this enormous state seeking to give
Losses their remedies All weary and oerwatchd
Take vantage heavy eyes not to behold
This shameful lodging
Fortune good night smile once more turn thy wheel

He sleeps

SCENE III The open Country

Enter Edgar

EDGAR
I heard myself proclaimd
And by the happy hollow of a tree
Escapd the hunt No port is free no place
That guard and most unusual vigilance
Does not attend my taking While I may scape
I will preserve myself and am bethought
To take the basest and most poorest shape
That ever penury in contempt of man
Brought near to beast my face Ill grime with filth
Blanket my loins elf all my hair in knots
And with presented nakedness outface
The winds and persecutions of the sky
The country gives me proof and precedent
Of Bedlam beggars who with roaring voices
Strike in their numbd and mortified bare arms
Pins wooden pricks nails sprigs of rosemary
And with this horrible object from low farms
Poor pelting villages sheepcotes and mills
Sometime with lunatic bans sometime with prayers
Enforce their charity Poor Turlygod poor Tom
Thats something yet Edgar I nothing am

Exit

SCENE IV Before Gloucesters Castle Kent in the stocks

Enter Lear Fool and Gentleman

LEAR
Tis strange that they should so depart from home
And not send back my messenger

GENTLEMAN
As I learnd
The night before there was no purpose in them
Of this remove

KENT
Hail to thee noble master

LEAR
Ha Makst thou this shame thy pastime

KENT
No my lord

FOOL
Ha ha he wears cruel garters Horses are tied by the
heads dogs and bears by the neck monkeys by the loins and
men by the legs when a man is overlusty at legs then he
wears wooden netherstocks

LEAR
Whats he that hath so much thy place mistook
To set thee here

KENT

Your son and daughter

LEAR

LEAR

KENT

LEAR
No no they would not

KENT
Yes they have

LEAR

KENT
By Juno I swear ay

LEAR
They durst not dot
They could not would not dot tis worse than murder
To do upon respect such violent outrage
Resolve me with all modest haste which way
Thou mightst deserve or they impose this usage
Coming from us

KENT
My lord when at their home
I did commend your highness letters to them
Ere I was risen from the place that showd
My duty kneeling came there a reeking post
Stewd in his haste half breathless panting forth
From Goneril his mistress salutations
Deliverd letters spite of intermission
Which presently they read on those contents
They summond up their meiny straight took horse
Commanded me to follow and attend
The leisure of their answer gave me cold looks
And meeting here the other messenger
Whose welcome I perceivd had poisond mine
Being the very fellow which of late
Displayd so saucily against your highness
Having more man than wit about me drew
He raisd the house with loud and coward cries
Your son and daughter found this trespass worth
The shame which here it suffers

FOOL
Winters not gone yet if the wild geese fly that way
Fathers that wear rags
Do make their children blind
But fathers that bear bags
Shall see their children kind
Fortune that arrant whore
Neer turns the key to th poor
But for all this thou shalt have as many dolours for thy
daughters as thou canst tell in a year

LEAR
O how this mother swells up toward my heart
Hysterica passio down thou climbing sorrow
Thy elements below Where is this daughter

LEAR
Follow me not stay here

Exit

GENTLEMAN
Made you no more offence but what you speak of

KENT
None
How chance the King comes with so small a number

FOOL
An thou hadst been set i the stocks for that question
thou hadst well deserved it

KENT
Why fool

FOOL
Well set thee to school to an ant to teach thee theres no
labouring ithe winter All that follow their noses are led by
their eyes but blind men and theres not a nose among twenty
but can smell him thats stinking Let go thy hold when a great
wheel runs down a hill lest it break thy neck with following
it but the great one that goes upward let him draw thee after
When a wise man gives thee better counsel give me mine again I
would have none but knaves follow it since a fool gives it
That sir which serves and seeks for gain
And follows but for form
Will pack when it begins to rain
And leave thee in the storm
But I will tarry the fool will stay
And let the wise man fly
The knave turns fool that runs away
The fool no knave perdy


KENT
Where learnd you this fool

FOOL
Not i the stocks fool

Enter Lear and Gloucester

LEAR

GLOUCESTER
My dear lord
You know the fiery quality of the Duke
How unremovable and fixd he is
In his own course

LEAR
Vengeance plague death confusion
Fiery What quality Why Gloucester Gloucester
Id speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife

GLOUCESTER
Well my good lord I have informd them so

LEAR

GLOUCESTER

LEAR
The King would speak with Cornwall the dear father
Would with his daughter speak commands tends service
Are they informd of this My breath and blood
Fiery The fiery Duke tell the hot Duke that
No but not yet maybe he is not well
Infirmity doth still neglect all office
Whereto our health is bound we are not ourselves
When nature being oppressd commands the mind
To suffer with the body Ill forbear
And am fallen out with my more headier will
To take the indisposd and sickly fit
For the sound man Looking on Kent
Death on my state Wherefore
Should he sit here This act persuades me
That this remotion of the Duke and her
Is practice only Give me my servant forth
Go tell the Duke ands wife Id speak with them
Now presently bid them come forth and hear me
Or at their chamber door Ill beat the drum
Till it cry sleep to death

GLOUCESTER

REGAN
I am glad to see your highness

LEAR
Regan I think you are I know what reason
I have to think so if thou shouldst not be glad
I would divorce me from thy mothers tomb
Sepulchring an adultress To Kent O are you free
Some other time for thatBeloved Regan
Thy sisters naught O Regan she hath tied
Sharptoothd unkindness like a vulture here

Points to his heart

I can scarce speak to thee thoult not believe
With how depravd a qualityO Regan

REGAN
I pray you sir take patience I have hope
You less know how to value her desert
Than she to scant her duty

LEAR
Say how is that

REGAN
I cannot think my sister in the least
Would fail her obligation If sir perchance
She have restraind the riots of your followers
Tis on such ground and to such wholesome end
As clears her from all blame

LEAR
My curses on her

REGAN
O sir you are old
Nature in you stands on the very verge
Of her confine you should be ruld and led
By some discretion that discerns your state
Better than you yourself Therefore I pray you
That to our sister you do make return
Say you have wrongd her sir

LEAR
Ask her forgiveness
Do you but mark how this becomes the house
Dear daughter I confess that I am old
Kneeling
Age is unnecessary on my knees I beg
That youll vouchsafe me raiment bed and food

REGAN
Good sir no more These are unsightly tricks
Return you to my sister

LEAR
Rising Never Regan
She hath abated me of half my train
Lookd black upon me struck me with her tongue
Most serpentlike upon the very heart
All the stord vengeances of heaven fall
On her ingrateful top Strike her young bones
You taking airs with lameness

CORNWALL
Fie sir fie

LEAR
You nimble lightnings dart your blinding flames
Into her scornful eyes Infect her beauty
You fensuckd fogs drawn by the powerful sun
To fall and blast her pride

REGAN
O the blest gods
So will you wish on me when the rash mood is on

LEAR
No Regan thou shalt never have my curse
Thy tenderhefted nature shall not give
Thee oer to harshness Her eyes are fierce but thine
Do comfort and not burn Tis not in thee
To grudge my pleasures to cut off my train
To bandy hasty words to scant my sizes
And in conclusion to oppose the bolt
Against my coming in Thou better knowst
The offices of nature bond of childhood
Effects of courtesy dues of gratitude
Thy half o the kingdom hast thou not forgot
Wherein I thee endowd

REGAN
Good sir to the purpose

LEAR
Who put my man i the stocks

Tucket within

CORNWALL
What trumpets that

REGAN
I knowt my sisters this approves her letter
That she would soon be here

Enter Oswald

Is your lady come

LEAR
This is a slave whose easy borrowed pride
Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows
Out varlet from my sight

CORNWALL
What means your grace

LEAR
Who stockd my servant Regan I have good hope
Thou didst not know ont Who comes here O heavens

Enter Goneril

If you do love old men if your sweet sway
Allow obedience if yourselves are old
Make it your cause send down and take my part
To Goneril Art not ashamd to look upon this beard
O Regan wilt thou take her by the hand

GONERIL
Why not by the hand sir How have I offended
Alls not offence that indiscretion finds
And dotage terms so

LEAR
O sides you are too tough
Will you yet hold How came my man i the stocks

CORNWALL
I set him there sir but his own disorders
Deservd much less advancement

LEAR
You Did you

REGAN
I pray you father being weak seem so
If till the expiration of your month
You will return and sojourn with my sister
Dismissing half your train come then to me
I am now from home and out of that provision
Which shall be needful for your entertainment

LEAR
Return to her and fifty men dismissd
No rather I abjure all roofs and choose
To wage against the enmity o the air
To be a comrade with the wolf and owl
Necessitys sharp pinch Return with her
Why the hotblooded France that dowerless took
Our youngest born I could as well be brought
To knee his throne and squirelike pension beg
To keep base life afoot Return with her
Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter
To this detested groom

Pointing to Oswald

GONERIL
At your choice sir

LEAR
I prythee daughter do not make me mad
I will not trouble thee my child farewell
Well no more meet no more see one another
But yet thou art my flesh my blood my daughter
Or rather a disease thats in my flesh
Which I must needs call mine Thou art a boil
A plague sore or embossed carbuncle
In my corrupted blood But Ill not chide thee
Let shame come when it will I do not call it
I do not bid the thunderbearer shoot
Nor tell tales of thee to highjudging Jove
Mend when thou canst be better at thy leisure
I can be patient I can stay with Regan
I and my hundred knights

REGAN
Not altogether so
I lookd not for you yet nor am provided
For your fit welcome Give ear sir to my sister
For those that mingle reason with your passion
Must be content to think you old and so
But she knows what she does

LEAR
Is this well spoken

REGAN
I dare avouch it sir what fifty followers
Is it not well What should you need of more
Yea or so many sith that both charge and danger
Speak gainst so great a number How in one house
Should many people under two commands
Hold amity Tis hard almost impossible

GONERIL
Why might not you my lord receive attendance
From those that she calls servants or from mine

REGAN
Why not my lord If then they chancd to slack ye
We could control them If you will come to me
For now I spy a dangerI entreat you
To bring but fiveandtwenty to no more
Will I give place or notice

LEAR
I gave you all

REGAN
And in good time you gave it

LEAR
Made you my guardians my depositaries
But kept a reservation to be followed
With such a number What must I come to you
With fiveandtwenty Regan said you so

REGAN
And speakt again my lord no more with me

LEAR
Those wicked creatures yet do look wellfavourd
When others are more wicked not being the worst
Stands in some rank of praise
To Goneril Ill go with thee
Thy fifty yet doth double fiveandtwenty
And thou art twice her love

GONERIL
Hear me my lord
What need you fiveandtwenty Ten Or five
To follow in a house where twice so many
Have a command to tend you

REGAN
What need one

LEAR
O reason not the need our basest beggars
Are in the poorest thing superfluous
Allow not nature more than nature needs
Mans life is cheap as beasts Thou art a lady
If only to go warm were gorgeous
Why nature needs not what thou gorgeous wearst
Which scarcely keeps thee warm But for true need
You heavens give me that patience patience I need
You see me here you gods a poor old man
As full of grief as age wretched in both
If it be you that stirs these daughters hearts
Against their father fool me not so much
To bear it tamely touch me with noble anger
And let not womens weapons waterdrops
Stain my mans cheeks No you unnatural hags
I will have such revenges on you both
That all the world shallI will do such things
What they are yet I know not but they shall be
The terrors of the earth You think Ill weep
No Ill not weep Storm and tempest
I have full cause of weeping but this heart
Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws
Or ere Ill weepO fool I shall go mad

Exeunt Lear Gloucester Kent and Fool

CORNWALL
Let us withdraw twill be a storm

REGAN
This house is little the old man and his people
Cannot be well bestowd

GONERIL

And must needs taste his folly

REGAN
For his particular Ill receive him gladly
But not one follower

GONERIL
So am I purposd
Where is my lord of Gloucester

Enter Gloucester

CORNWALL
Tis best to give him way he leads himself

GONERIL
My lord entreat him by no means to stay

GLOUCESTER
Alack the night comes on and the high winds
Do sorely ruffle for many miles about
Theres scarce a bush

REGAN
O sir to wilful men
The injuries that they themselves procure
Must be their schoolmasters Shut up your doors
He is attended with a desperate train
And what they may incense him to being apt
To have his ear abusd wisdom bids fear

CORNWALL
Shut up your doors my lord tis a wild night
My Regan counsels well come out o the storm

Exeunt

KENT
Whos there besides foul weather

GENTLEMAN
One minded like the weather most unquietly

KENT
I know you Wheres the King

GENTLEMAN
Contending with the fretful elements
Bids the wind blow the earth into the sea
Or swell the curled waters bove the main
That things might change or cease tears his white hair
Which the impetuous blasts with eyeless rage
Catch in their fury and make nothing of
Strives in his little world of man to outscorn
The toandfroconflicting wind and rain
This night wherein the cubdrawn bear would couch
The lion and the bellypinched wolf
Keep their fur dry unbonneted he runs
And bids what will take all

KENT
But who is with him

GENTLEMAN
None but the fool who labours to outjest
His heartstruck injuries

KENT
Sir I do know you
And dare upon the warrant of my note
Commend a dear thing to you There is division
Although as yet the face of it be coverd
With mutual cunning twixt Albany and Cornwall
Who have as who have not that their great stars
Throned and set high servants who seem no less
Which are to France the spies and speculations
Intelligent of our state What hath been seen
Either in snuffs and packings of the Dukes
Or the hard rein which both of them have borne
Against the old kind King or something deeper
Whereof perchance these are but furnishings
But true it is from France there comes a power
Into this scatterd kingdom who already
Wise in our negligence have secret feet
In some of our best ports and are at point
To show their open bannerNow to you
If on my credit you dare build so far
To make your speed to Dover you shall find
Some that will thank you making just report
Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow
The King hath cause to plain
I am a gentleman of blood and breeding
And from some knowledge and assurance
Offer this office to you

GENTLEMAN
I will talk further with you

KENT
No do not
For confirmation that I am much more
Than my outwall open this purse and take
What it contains If you shall see Cordelia
As fear not but you shall show her this ring
And she will tell you who your fellow is
That yet you do not know Fie on this storm
I will go seek the King

GENTLEMAN
Give me your hand have you no more to say

KENT
Few words but to effect more than all yet
That when we have found the King in which your pain
That way Ill this he that first lights on him
Holla the other

Strike flat the thick rotundity o the world
Crack natures moulds all germens spill at once
That make ingrateful man

FOOL

Nor rain wind thunder fire are my daughters
I tax not you you elements with unkindness

A poor infirm weak and despisd old man
But yet I call you servile ministers
That will with two pernicious daughters join
Your highengenderd battles gainst a head
So old and white as this O O tis foul

FOOL
He that has a house to puts head in has a good headpiece
The codpiece that will house
Before the head has any
The head and he shall louse
So beggars marry many
The man that makes his toe
What he his heart should make
Shall of a corn cry woe
And turn his sleep to wake
For there was never yet fair woman but she made mouths in a glass

LEAR
No I will be the pattern of all patience
I will say nothing

Enter Kent

KENT
Whos there

FOOL

fool

KENT
Alas sir are you here Things that love night
Love not such nights as these the wrathful skies
Gallow the very wanderers of the dark
And make them keep their caves Since I was man
Such sheets of fire such bursts of horrid thunder
Such groans of roaring wind and rain I never
Remember to have heard Mans nature cannot carry
Thaffliction nor the fear

LEAR
Let the great gods
That keep this dreadful pudder oer our heads
Find out their enemies now Tremble thou wretch
That hast within thee undivulged crimes
Unwhippd of justice Hide thee thou bloody hand
Thou perjurd and thou simular of virtue
That art incestuous Caitiff to pieces shake
That under covert and convenient seeming
Hast practisd on mans life close pentup guilts
Rive your concealing continents and cry
These dreadful summoners grace I am a man
More sinnd against than sinning

KENT
Alack bareheaded
Gracious my lord hard by here is a hovel
Some friendship will it lend you gainst the tempest
Repose you there whilst I to this hard house
More harder than the stones whereof tis raisd
Which even but now demanding after you
Denied me to come inreturn and force
Their scanted courtesy

LEAR
My wits begin to turn
Come on my boy How dost my boy Art cold
I am cold myself Where is this straw my fellow
The art of our necessities is strange
That can make vile things precious Come your hovel
Poor fool and knave I have one part in my heart
Thats sorry yet for thee

FOOL
Singing
He that has and a little tiny wit
With heighho the wind and the rain
Must make content with his fortunes fit
Though the rain it raineth every day

LEAR
True boy Come bring us to this hovel

Exeunt Lear and Kent

FOOL
This is a brave night to cool a courtezan Ill speak a prophecy
ere I go
When priests are more in word than matter
When brewers mar their malt with water
When nobles are their tailors tutors
No heretics burnd but wenches suitors
When every case in law is right
No squire in debt nor no poor knight
When slanders do not live in tongues
Nor cutpurses come not to throngs
When usurers tell their gold i the field
And bawds and whores do churches build
Then shall the realm of Albion
Come to great confusion
Then comes the time who lives to seet
That going shall be usd with feet
This prophecy Merlin shall make for I live before his time

Here is the place my lord good my lord enter
The tyranny of the open nights too rough
For nature to endure

LEAR
Let me alone

KENT
Good my lord enter here

LEAR
Wilt break my heart

KENT
I had rather break mine own Good my lord enter

LEAR
Thou thinkst tis much that this contentious storm
Invades us to the skin so tis to thee
But where the greater malady is fixd
The lesser is scarce felt Thoudst shun a bear
But if thy flight lay toward the raging sea
Thoudst meet the bear i the mouth When the minds
free
The bodys delicate the tempest in my mind
Doth from my senses take all feeling else
Save what beats there Filial ingratitude
Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand
For lifting food tot But I will punish home
No I will weep no more In such a night
To shut me out Pour on I will endure
In such a night as this O Regan Goneril
Your old kind father whose frank heart gave all
O that way madness lies let me shun that
No more of that

KENT
Good my lord enter here

LEAR
Prythee go in thyself seek thine own ease
This tempest will not give me leave to ponder
On things would hurt me more But Ill go in
To the Fool In boy go first You houseless poverty
Nay get thee in Ill pray and then Ill sleep

Fool goes in

Poor naked wretches wheresoeer you are
That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm
How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides
Your loopd and windowd raggedness defend you
From seasons such as these O I have taen
Too little care of this Take physic pomp
Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel
That thou mayst shake the superflux to them
And show the heavens more just

did the act of darkness with her swore as many oaths as I spake
words and broke them in the sweet face of heaven One that
slept in the contriving of lust and waked to do it Wine loved
I deeply dice dearly and in woman outparamourd the Turk
False of heart light of ear bloody of hand hog in sloth fox
in stealth wolf in greediness dog in madness lion in prey
Let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling of silks betray
thy poor heart to woman Keep thy foot out of brothels thy hand
out of plackets thy pen from lenders book and defy the foul
fiend Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind says
suum mun nonny Dolphin my boy boy sessa let him trot by

This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet he begins at curfew and walks
till the first cock he gives the web and the pin squints the eye and
makes the harelip mildews the white wheat and hurts the poor creature

EDMUND
How my lord I may be censured that nature thus gives way to
loyalty something fears me to think of

CORNWALL
I now perceive it was not altogether your brothers evil
disposition made him seek his death but a provoking merit set
awork by a reproveable badness in himself

EDMUND
How malicious is my fortune that I must repent to be just This
is the letter he spoke of which approves him an intelligent
party to the advantages of France O heavens that this treason
were not or not I the detector

CORNWALL

suspicion more fully I will persever in my course of loyalty

Be thy mouth or black or white
Tooth that poisons if it bite

Exeunt Kent Gloucester and the Fool bearing off Lear

EDGAR
When we our betters see bearing our woes
We scarcely think our miseries our foes
Who alone suffers suffers most i the mind
Leaving free things and happy shows behind
But then the mind much sufferance doth oerskip
When grief hath mates and bearing fellowship
How light and portable my pain seems now
When that which makes me bend makes the King bow
He childed as I fathered Tom away
Mark the high noises and thyself bewray
When false opinion whose wrong thoughts defile thee
In thy just proof repeals and reconciles thee
What will hap more tonight safe scape the King
Lurk lurk

His answer was The worse Of Gloucesters treachery
And of the loyal service of his son
When I informd him then he calld me sot
And told me I had turnd the wrong side out
What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him
What like offensive

GONERIL
To Edmund Then shall you go no further
It is the cowish terror of his spirit
That dares not undertake Hell not feel wrongs
Which tie him to an answer Our wishes on the way
May prove effects Back Edmund to my brother
Hasten his musters and conduct his powers
I must change names at home and give the distaff
Into my husbands hands This trusty servant
Shall pass between us Ere long you are like to hear
If you dare venture in your own behalf
A mistresss command Giving a favour
Wear this spare speech
Decline your head This kiss if it durst speak
Would stretch thy spirits up into the air
Conceive and fare thee well

ALBANY
O Goneril
You are not worth the dust which the rude wind
Blows in your face I fear your disposition
That nature which contemns its origin
Cannot be bordered certain in itself
She that herself will sliver and disbranch
From her material sap perforce must wither
And come to deadly use

GONERIL
No more the text is foolish

ALBANY
Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile
Filths savour but themselves What have you done
Tigers not daughters what have you performd
A father and a gracious aged man
Whose reverence even the headluggd bear would lick
Most barbarous most degenerate have you madded
Could my good brother suffer you to do it
A man a prince by him so benefitted
If that the heavens do not their visible spirits
Send quickly down to tame these vile offences
It will come
Humanity must perforce prey on itself
Like monsters of the deep

GONERIL
Milkliverd man
That bearst a cheek for blows a head for wrongs
Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning
Thine honour from thy suffering that not knowst
Fools do those villains pity who are punishd
Ere they have done their mischief Wheres thy drum
France spreads his banners in our noiseless land
With plumed helm thy state begins to threat
Whilst thou a moral fool sittst still and criest
Alack why does he so

ALBANY
See thyself devil
Proper deformity seems not in the fiend
So horrid as in woman

GONERIL
O vain fool

ALBANY
Thou changed and selfcoverd thing for shame
Bemonster not thy feature Weret my fitness
To let these hands obey my blood
They are apt enough to dislocate and tear
Thy flesh and bones Howeer thou art a fiend
A womans shape doth shield thee

GONERIL
Marry your manhood mew

Enter a Messenger

ALBANY
What news

MESSENGER
O my good lord the Duke of Cornwalls dead
Slain by his servant going to put out
The other eye of Gloucester

ALBANY
Gloucesters eyes

MESSENGER
A servant that he bred thrilld with remorse
Opposd against the act bending his sword
To his great master who thereat enragd
Flew on him and amongst them felld him dead
But not without that harmful stroke which since
Hath pluckd him after

ALBANY
This shows you are above
You justicers that these our nether crimes
So speedily can venge But O poor Gloucester
Lost he his other eye

MESSENGER
Both both my lord
This letter madam craves a speedy answer
Tis from your sister

GONERIL
Aside One way I like this well
But being widow and my Gloucester with her
May all the building in my fancy pluck
Upon my hateful life Another way
The news is not so tart Ill read and answer

Exit

ALBANY
Where was his son when they did take his eyes

MESSENGER
Come with my lady hither

ALBANY
He is not here

MESSENGER
No my good lord I met him back again

ALBANY
Knows he the wickedness

MESSENGER
Ay my good lord Twas he informd against him
And quit the house on purpose that their punishment
Might have the freer course

ALBANY
Gloucester I live
To thank thee for the love thou showdst the King
And to revenge thine eyes Come hither friend
Tell me what more thou knowst

Exeunt

SCENE III The French camp near Dover

Enter Kent and a Gentleman

KENT
Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back know you no
reason

GENTLEMAN
Something he left imperfect in the state which since his coming
forth is thought of which imports to the kingdom so much fear
and danger that his personal return was most required and
necessary

KENT
Who hath he left behind him general

GENTLEMAN
The Mareschal of France Monsieur La Far

KENT
Did your letters pierce the queen to any demonstration of grief

GENTLEMAN
Ay sir she took them read them in my presence
And now and then an ample tear trilld down
Her delicate cheek It seemd she was a queen
Over her passion who most rebellike
Sought to be king oer her

KENT
O then it movd her

GENTLEMAN
Not to a rage patience and sorrow strove
Who should express her goodliest You have seen
Sunshine and rain at once her smiles and tears
Were like a better day Those happy smilets
That playd on her ripe lip seemd not to know
What guests were in her eyes which parted thence
As pearls from diamonds droppd In brief
Sorrow would be a rarity most belovd
If all could so become it

KENT
Made she no verbal question

GENTLEMAN
Faith once or twice she heavd the name of father
Pantingly forth as if it pressd her heart
Cried Sisters sisters Shame of ladies sisters
Kent father sisters What i the storm i the night
Let pity not be believd There she shook
The holy water from her heavenly eyes
And clamour masterd her then away she started
To deal with grief alone

KENT
It is the stars
The stars above us govern our conditions
Else one self mate and make could not beget
Such different issues You spoke not with her since

GENTLEMAN
No

KENT
Was this before the King returnd

GENTLEMAN
No since

KENT
Well sir the poor distressed Lears i the town
Who sometime in his better tune remembers
What we are come about and by no means
Will yield to see his daughter

GENTLEMAN
Why good sir

KENT
A sovereign shame so elbows him His own unkindness
That strippd her from his benediction turnd her
To foreign casualties gave her dear rights
To his doghearted daughters these things sting
His mind so venomously that burning shame
Detains him from Cordelia

GENTLEMAN
Alack poor gentleman

KENT
Of Albanys and Cornwalls powers you heard not

GENTLEMAN
Tis so they are afoot

KENT
Well sir Ill bring you to our master Lear
And leave you to attend him Some dear cause
Will in concealment wrap me up awhile
When I am known aright you shall not grieve
Lending me this acquaintance
I pray you go along with me

Exeunt

SCENE IV The French camp A Tent

Enter with drum and colours Cordelia Physician
and Soldiers

CORDELIA
Alack tis he why he was met even now
As mad as the vexd sea singing aloud
Crownd with rank fumiter and furrow weeds
With harlocks hemlock nettles cuckooflowers
Darnel and all the idle weeds that grow
In our sustaining corn A century send forth
Search every acre in the highgrown field
And bring him to our eye

Exit an Officer

What can mans wisdom
In the restoring his bereaved sense
He that helps him take all my outward worth

PHYSICIAN
There is means madam
Our foster nurse of nature is repose
The which he lacks that to provoke in him
Are many simples operative whose power
Will close the eye of anguish

CORDELIA
All blessd secrets
All you unpublishd virtues of the earth
Spring with my tears Be aidant and remediate
In the good mans distress Seek seek for him
Lest his ungovernd rage dissolve the life
That wants the means to lead it

Enter a Messenger

MESSENGER
News madam
The British powers are marching hitherward

CORDELIA
Tis known before Our preparation stands
In expectation of them O dear father
It is thy business that I go about
Therefore great France
My mourning and important tears hath pitied
No blown ambition doth our arms incite
But love dear love and our agd fathers right
Soon may I hear and see him

Exeunt

SCENE V A Room in Gloucesters Castle

Enter Regan and Oswald

REGAN
But are my brothers powers set forth

OSWALD
Ay madam

REGAN
Himself in person there

OSWALD
Madam with much ado
Your sister is the better soldier

REGAN
Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home

OSWALD
No madam

REGAN
What might import my sisters letter to him

OSWALD
I know not lady

REGAN
Faith he is posted hence on serious matter
It was great ignorance Gloucesters eyes being out
To let him live Where he arrives he moves
All hearts against us Edmund I think is gone
In pity of his misery to dispatch
His nighted life moreover to descry
The strength o thenemy

OSWALD
I must needs after him madam with my letter

REGAN
Our troops set forth tomorrow stay with us
The ways are dangerous

OSWALD
I may not madam
My lady chargd my duty in this business

REGAN
Why should she write to Edmund Might not you
Transport her purposes by word Belike
Somethings I know not what Ill love thee much
Let me unseal the letter

OSWALD
Madam I had rather

REGAN
I know your lady does not love her husband
I am sure of that and at her late being here
She gave strange oeillades and most speaking looks
To noble Edmund I know you are of her bosom

OSWALD
I madam

REGAN
I speak in understanding yare I knowt
Therefore I do advise you take this note
My lord is dead Edmund and I have talkd
And more convenient is he for my hand
Than for your ladys You may gather more
If you do find him pray you give him this
And when your mistress hears thus much from you
I pray desire her call her wisdom to her
So fare you well
If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor
Preferment falls on him that cuts him off

OSWALD
Would I could meet him madam I should show
What party I do follow

REGAN
Fare thee well

Exeunt

SCENE VI The country near Dover

Enter Gloucester and Edgar dressed like a peasant

GLOUCESTER
When shall I come to the top of that same hill

EDGAR
You do climb up it now Look how we labour

GLOUCESTER
Methinks the ground is even

EDGAR
Horrible steep
Hark do you hear the sea

GLOUCESTER
No truly

EDGAR
Why then your other senses grow imperfect
By your eyes anguish

GLOUCESTER
So may it be indeed
Methinks thy voice is alterd and thou speakst
In better phrase and matter than thou didst

EDGAR
Yare much deceivd in nothing am I changd
But in my garments

GLOUCESTER
Methinks youre better spoken

EDGAR
Come on sir heres the place Stand still How fearful
And dizzy tis to cast ones eyes so low
The crows and choughs that wing the midway air
Show scarce so gross as beetles Half way down
Hangs one that gathers samphiredreadful trade
Methinks he seems no bigger than his head
The fishermen that walk upon the beach
Appear like mice and yond tall anchoring bark
Diminishd to her cock her cock a buoy
Almost too small for sight the murmuring surge
That on thunnumberd idle pebble chafes
Cannot be heard so high Ill look no more
Lest my brain turn and the deficient sight
Topple down headlong

GLOUCESTER
Set me where you stand

EDGAR
Give me your hand
You are now within a foot of thextreme verge
For all beneath the moon would I not leap upright

GLOUCESTER
Let go my hand
Here friend s another purse in it a jewel
Well worth a poor mans taking Fairies and gods
Prosper it with thee Go thou further off
Bid me farewell and let me hear thee going

EDGAR
Now fare ye well good sir

Seems to go

GLOUCESTER
With all my heart

EDGAR
Aside Why I do trifle thus with his despair
Is done to cure it

GLOUCESTER
O you mighty gods
This world I do renounce and in your sights
Shake patiently my great affliction off
If I could bear it longer and not fall
To quarrel with your great opposeless wills
My snuff and loathed part of nature should
Burn itself out If Edgar live O bless him
Now fellow fare thee well

EDGAR
Gone sir farewell

Gloucester leaps and falls along

And yet I know not how conceit may rob
The treasury of life when life itself
Yields to the theft Had he been where he thought
By this had thought been past Alive or dead
Ho you sir friend Hear you sir speak
Thus might he pass indeed yet he revives
What are you sir

GLOUCESTER
Away and let me die

EDGAR
Hadst thou been aught but gossamer feathers air
So many fathom down precipitating
Thoudst shiverd like an egg but thou dost breathe
Hast heavy substance bleedst not speakst art sound
Ten masts at each make not the altitude
Which thou hast perpendicularly fell
Thy life is a miracle Speak yet again

GLOUCESTER
But have I falln or no

EDGAR
From the dread summit of this chalky bourn
Look up aheight the shrillgorgd lark so far
Cannot be seen or heard Do but look up

GLOUCESTER
Alack I have no eyes
Is wretchedness deprivd that benefit
To end itself by death Twas yet some comfort
When misery could beguile the tyrants rage
And frustrate his proud will

EDGAR
Give me your arm
Up so How ist Feel you your legs You stand

GLOUCESTER
Too well too well

EDGAR
This is above all strangeness
Upon the crown o the cliff what thing was that
Which parted from you

GLOUCESTER
A poor unfortunate beggar

EDGAR
As I stood here below methought his eyes
Were two full moons he had a thousand noses
Horns whelkd and waved like the enraged sea
It was some fiend Therefore thou happy father
Think that the clearest gods who make them honours
Of mens impossibilities have preservd thee

GLOUCESTER
I do remember now henceforth Ill bear
Affliction till it do cry out itself
Enough enough and die That thing you speak of
I took it for a man often twould say
The fiend the fiend he led me to that place

EDGAR
Bear free and patient thoughts But who comes here

Enter Lear fantastically
dressed up with flowers

The safer sense will neer accommodate
His master thus

LEAR
No they cannot touch me for coining I am the King himself

EDGAR
O thou sidepiercing sight

LEAR
Natures above art in that respect Theres your press money
That fellow handles his bow like a crowkeeper draw me a clothiers
yard Look look a mouse Peace peace this piece of toasted cheese
will dot Theres my gauntlet Ill prove it on a giant
Bring up the brown bills O well flown bird i the clout i
the clout Hewgh Give the word

EDGAR
Sweet marjoram

LEAR
Pass

GLOUCESTER
I know that voice

LEAR
Ha Goneril with a white beard They flattered me like a dog and told
me I had white hairs in my beard ere the black ones were there To say
ay and no to everything I said ay
and no to was no good divinity When the rain came to wet
me once and the wind to make me chatter when the thunder would not
peace at my bidding there I found em there I smelt em out
Go to they are not men o their words they told me I was everything
tis a lie I am not agueproof

GLOUCESTER
The trick of that voice I do well remember
Ist not the King

LEAR
Ay every inch a king
When I do stare see how the subject quakes
I pardon that mans life What was thy cause
Adultery Thou shalt not die die for adultery No
The wren goes tot and the small gilded fly
Does lecher in my sight Let copulation thrive
For Gloucesters bastard son was kinder to his father
Than my daughters got tween the lawful sheets
Tot luxury pellmell for I lack soldiers
Behold yond simpring dame
Whose face between her forks presages snow
That minces virtue and does shake the head
To hear of pleasures name
The fitchew nor the soiled horse goes tot with a more riotous
appetite Down from the waist they are centaurs though women all
above But to the girdle do the gods inherit beneath is all the
fiends theres hell theres darkness there is the sulphurous pit
burning scalding stench
consumption Fie fie fie pah pah Give me an ounce of civet good
apothecary to sweeten my imagination Theres money for thee

GLOUCESTER
O let me kiss that hand

LEAR
Let me wipe it first it smells of mortality

GLOUCESTER
O ruind piece of nature this great world
Shall so wear out to naught Dost thou know me

LEAR
I remember thine eyes well enough Dost thou squiny at me
No do thy worst blind Cupid Ill not love
Read thou this challenge mark but the penning of it

GLOUCESTER
Were all the letters suns I could not see one

EDGAR
I would not take this from report
It is and my heart breaks at it

LEAR
Read

GLOUCESTER
What with the case of eyes

LEAR
O ho are you there with me No eyes in your head nor no money
in your purse Your eyes are in a heavy case your purse in a
light yet you see how this world goes

GLOUCESTER
I see it feelingly

LEAR
What art mad A man may see how the world goes with no eyes
Look with thine ears See how yon justice rails upon yon simple
thief Hark in thine ear change places and handydandy which
is the justice which is the thief Thou hast seen a farmers
dog bark at a beggar

GLOUCESTER
Ay sir

LEAR
And the creature run from the cur There thou mightst behold
the great image of authority a dogs obeyed in office
Thou rascal beadle hold thy bloody hand
Why dost thou lash that whore Strip thine own back
Thou hotly lusts to use her in that kind
For which thou whippst her The usurer hangs the cozener
Through tatterd clothes great vices do appear
Robes and furrd gowns hide all Plate sin with gold
And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks
Arm it in rags a pygmys straw does pierce it
None does offend none I say none Ill able em
Take that of me my friend who have the power
To seal the accusers lips Get thee glass eyes
And like a scurvy politician seem
To see the things thou dost not Now now now now
Pull off my boots harder harder so

EDGAR
O matter and impertinency mixd
Reason in madness

LEAR
If thou wilt weep my fortunes take my eyes
I know thee well enough thy name is Gloucester
Thou must be patient we came crying hither
Thou knowst the first time that we smell the air
We wawl and cry I will preach to thee mark

GLOUCESTER
Alack alack the day

LEAR
When we are born we cry that we are come
To this great stage of fools This a good block
It were a delicate stratagem to shoe
A troop of horse with felt Ill putt in proof
And when I have stoln upon these soninlaws
Then kill kill kill kill kill kill

Enter a Gentleman with
Attendants

GENTLEMAN

GENTLEMAN

LEAR

Why this would make a man a man of salt
To use his eyes for garden waterpots
Ay and for laying autumns dust

GENTLEMAN

LEAR

GENTLEMAN
Near and on speedy foot the main descry
Stands on the hourly thought

EDGAR
I thank you sir thats all

GENTLEMAN
Though that the queen on special cause is here
Her army is movd on

EDGAR
I thank you sir

Exit Gentleman

Let not my worser spirit tempt me again
To die before you please

EDGAR
Well pray you father

GLOUCESTER
Now good sir what are you

EDGAR
A most poor man made tame to fortunes blows
Who by the art of known and feeling sorrows
Am pregnant to good pity Give me your hand

Of the deathpractisd Duke for him tis well
That of thy death and business I can tell

Exit Edgar dragging out the body

GLOUCESTER
The King is mad how stiff is my vile sense
That I stand up and have ingenious feeling
Of my huge sorrows Better I were distract
So should my thoughts be severd from my griefs
And woes by wrong imaginations lose
The knowledge of themselves

A drum afar off

EDGAR
Give me your hand
Far off methinks I hear the beaten drum
Come father Ill bestow you with a friend

Exeunt

SCENE VII A Tent in the French Camp

Lear on a bed asleep soft
music playing Physician Gentleman and others
attending

Enter Cordelia and Kent

CORDELIA
O thou good Kent how shall I live and work
To match thy goodness My life will be too short
And every measure fail me

KENT
To be acknowledgd madam is oerpaid
All my reports go with the modest truth
Nor more nor clippd but so

CORDELIA
Be better suited
These weeds are memories of those worser hours
I prythee put them off

KENT
Pardon dear madam
Yet to be known shortens my made intent
My boon I make it that you know me not
Till time and I think meet

CORDELIA
Then bet so my good lord To the Physician How does the King

PHYSICIAN
Madam sleeps still

CORDELIA

Cure this great breach in his abused nature
The untund and jarring senses O wind up
Of this childchanged father

PHYSICIAN

That we may wake the King he hath slept long

CORDELIA
Be governd by your knowledge and proceed

PHYSICIAN

CORDELIA

PHYSICIAN
Please you draw near Louder the music there

CORDELIA
O my dear father Restoration hang
Thy medicine on my lips and let this kiss
Repair those violent harms that my two sisters
Have in thy reverence made

KENT
Kind and dear princess

CORDELIA
Had you not been their father these white flakes
Did challenge pity of them Was this a face
To be opposd against the warring winds
To stand against the deep dreadbolted thunder
In the most terrible and nimble stroke
Of quick cross lightning to watch poor perdu
With this thin helm Mine enemys dog
Though he had bit me should have stood that night
Against my fire and wast thou fain poor father
To hovel thee with swine and rogues forlorn
In short and musty straw Alack alack
Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once
Had not concluded all He wakes speak to him

PHYSICIAN
Madam do you tis fittest

CORDELIA
How does my royal lord How fares your majesty

LEAR
You do me wrong to take me out o the grave
Thou art a soul in bliss but I am bound
Upon a wheel of fire that mine own tears
Do scald like molten lead

CORDELIA
Sir do you know me

LEAR
You are a spirit I know when did you die

CORDELIA
Still still far wide

PHYSICIAN
Hes scarce awake let him alone awhile

LEAR
Where have I been Where am I Fair daylight
I am mightily abusd I should een die with pity
To see another thus I know not what to say
I will not swear these are my hands lets see
I feel this pin prick Would I were assurd
Of my condition

CORDELIA
O look upon me sir
And hold your hands in benediction oer me
No sir you must not kneel

LEAR
Pray do not mock me
I am a very foolish fond old man
Fourscore and upward not an hour more nor less
And to deal plainly
I fear I am not in my perfect mind
Methinks I should know you and know this man
Yet I am doubtful for I am mainly ignorant
What place this is and all the skill I have
Remembers not these garments nor I know not
Where I did lodge last night Do not laugh at me
For as I am a man I think this lady
To be my child Cordelia

CORDELIA
And so I am I am

LEAR
Be your tears wet Yes faith I pray weep not
If you have poison for me I will drink it
I know you do not love me for your sisters
Have as I do remember done me wrong
You have some cause they have not

CORDELIA
No cause no cause

Exasperates makes mad her sister Goneril
And hardly shall I carry out my side
Her husband being alive Now then well use
His countenance for the battle which being done
Let her who would be rid of him devise
His speedy taking off As for the mercy
Which he intends to Lear and to Cordelia
The battle done and they within our power
Shall never see his pardon for my state
Stands on me to defend not to debate

For thee oppressed King I am cast down
Myself could else outfrown false fortunes frown
Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters

LEAR

We two alone will sing like birds i the cage
When thou dost ask me blessing Ill kneel down
And ask of thee forgiveness So well live
And pray and sing and tell old tales and laugh
At gilded butterflies and hear poor rogues
Talk of court news and well talk with them too
Who loses and who wins whos in whos out
And take upons the mystery of things
As if we were Gods spies And well wear out
In a walld prison packs and sects of great ones
That ebb and flow by the moon

EDMUND
Take them away

LEAR
Upon such sacrifices my Cordelia
The gods themselves throw incense Have I caught thee

ALBANY
Sir you have showd today your valiant strain
And fortune led you well you have the captives
Who were the opposites of this days strife
I do require them of you so to use them
As we shall find their merits and our safety
May equally determine

EDMUND
Sir I thought it fit
To send the old and miserable King
To some retention and appointed guard
Whose age has charms in it whose title more
To pluck the common bosom on his side
And turn our impressd lances in our eyes
Which do command them With him I sent the queen
My reason all the same and they are ready
Tomorrow or at further space to appear
Where you shall hold your session At this time
We sweat and bleed the friend hath lost his friend
And the best quarrels in the heat are cursd
By those that feel their sharpness
The question of Cordelia and her father
Requires a fitter place

ALBANY
Sir by your patience
I hold you but a subject of this war
Not as a brother

REGAN
Thats as we list to grace him
Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded
Ere you had spoke so far He led our powers
Bore the commission of my place and person
The which immediacy may well stand up
And call itself your brother

GONERIL
Not so hot
In his own grace he doth exalt himself
More than in your addition

REGAN
In my rights
By me invested he compeers the best

ALBANY
That were the most if he should husband you

REGAN
Jesters do oft prove prophets

EDGAR

By treasons tooth baregnawn and cankerbit
Yet am I noble as the adversary
I come to cope

ALBANY
Which is that adversary

EDGAR
Whats he that speaks for Edmund Earl of Gloucester

EDMUND
Himself what sayst thou to him

EDGAR
Draw thy sword
That if my speech offend a noble heart
Thy arm may do thee justice here is mine
Behold it is the privilege of mine honours
My oath and my profession I protest
Maugre thy strength youth place and eminence
Despite thy victor sword and firenew fortune
Thy valour and thy heart thou art a traitor
False to thy gods thy brother and thy father
Conspirant gainst this high illustrious prince
And from the extremest upward of thy head
To the descent and dust beneath thy foot
A most toadspotted traitor Say thou No
This sword this arm and my best spirits are bent
To prove upon thy heart whereto I speak
Thou liest

EDMUND
In wisdom I should ask thy name
But since thy outside looks so fair and warlike
And that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes
What safe and nicely I might well delay
By rule of knighthood I disdain and spurn
Back do I toss those treasons to thy head
With the hellhated lie oerwhelm thy heart
Which for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise
This sword of mine shall give them instant way
Where they shall rest for ever Trumpets speak

Alarums They fight Edmund falls

ALBANY
Save him save him

GONERIL
This is mere practice Gloucester
By the law of arms thou wast not bound to answer
An unknown opposite thou art not vanquishd
But cozend and beguild

ALBANY
Shut your mouth dame
Or with this paper shall I stop it Hold sir
Thou worse than any name read thine own evil
No tearing lady I perceive you know it

Gives the letter to Edmund

GONERIL
Say if I do the laws are mine not thine
Who can arraign me fort

Exit

ALBANY
Most monstrous O
Knowst thou this paper

EDMUND
Ask me not what I know

ALBANY
To an Officer who goes out Go after her shes desperate

EDMUND
What you have chargd me with that have I done
And more much more the time will bring it out
Tis past and so am I But what art thou
That hast this fortune on me If thourt noble
I do forgive thee

EDGAR
Lets exchange charity
I am no less in blood than thou art Edmund
If more the more thou hast wrongd me
My name is Edgar and thy fathers son
The gods are just and of our pleasant vices
Make instruments to plague us
The dark and vicious place where thee he got
Cost him his eyes

EDMUND
Thou hast spoken right tis true
The wheel is come full circle I am here

ALBANY
Methought thy very gait did prophesy
A royal nobleness I must embrace thee
Let sorrow split my heart if ever I
Did hate thee or thy father

EDGAR
Worthy prince I knowt

ALBANY
Where have you hid yourself
How have you known the miseries of your father

EDGAR
By nursing them my lord List a brief tale
And when tis told O that my heart would burst
The bloody proclamation to escape
That followd me so nearO our lives sweetness
That with the pain of death wed hourly die
Rather than die at oncetaught me to shift
Into a madmans rags tassume a semblance
That very dogs disdaind and in this habit
Met I my father with his bleeding rings
Their precious stones new lost became his guide
Led him beggd for him savd him from despair
NeverO faultreveald myself unto him
Until some half hour past when I was armd
Not sure though hoping of this good success
I askd his blessing and from first to last
Told him my pilgrimage But his flawd heart
Alack too weak the conflict to support
Twixt two extremes of passion joy and grief
Burst smilingly

EDMUND
This speech of yours hath movd me
And shall perchance do good but speak you on
You look as you had something more to say

ALBANY
If there be more more woeful hold it in
For I am almost ready to dissolve
Hearing of this

EDGAR
This would have seemd a period
To such as love not sorrow but another
To amplify too much would make much more
And top extremity
Whilst I was big in clamour came there a man
Who having seen me in my worst estate
Shunnd my abhorrd society but then finding
Who twas that so endurd with his strong arms
He fastened on my neck and bellowd out
As hed burst heaven threw him on my father
Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him
That ever ear receivd which in recounting
His grief grew puissant and the strings of life
Began to crack Twice then the trumpets sounded
And there I left him trancd

ALBANY
But who was this

EDGAR
Kent sir the banishd Kent who in disguise
Followd his enemy king and did him service
Improper for a slave

Enter a Gentleman hastily
with a bloody knife

GENTLEMAN
Help help O help

EDGAR

EDGAR
Here comes Kent

Enter Kent

ALBANY
Produce their bodies be they alive or dead
This judgement of the heavens that makes us tremble
Touches us not with pity O is this he
The time will not allow the compliment
Which very manners urges

KENT
I am come
To bid my King and master aye good night
Is he not here

ALBANY
Great thing of us forgot

Regan are brought in

The one the other poisoned for my sake
And after slew herself

ALBANY
Even so Cover their faces

EDMUND

Despite of mine own nature Quickly send
Be brief in it to the castle for my writ
Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia

EDGAR
Haste thee for thy life

Exit Edgar

EDMUND
He hath commission from thy wife and me
To hang Cordelia in the prison and
To lay the blame upon her own despair
That she fordid herself

ALBANY
The gods defend her Bear him hence awhile

Edmund is borne off

Enter Lear with Cordelia dead in his arms Edgar

I know when one is dead and when one lives
Shes dead as earth Lend me a looking glass
If that her breath will mist or stain the stone
Why then she lives

KENT
Is this the promisd end

EDGAR
Or image of that horror

ALBANY
Fall and cease

LEAR
This feather stirs she lives If it be so
It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows
That ever I have felt

EDGAR
