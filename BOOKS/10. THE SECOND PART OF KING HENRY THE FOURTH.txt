INDUCTION


Warkworth Before the castle

Enter Rumour painted full of tongues

RUMOUR
Open your ears for which of you will stop
The vent of hearing when loud Rumour speaks
I from the orient to the drooping west
Making the wind my posthorse still unfold
The acts commenced on this ball of earth
Upon my tongues continual slanders ride
The which in every language I pronounce
Stuffing the ears of men with false reports
I speak of peace while covert enmity
Under the smile of safety wounds the world
And who but Rumour who but only I
Make fearful musters and prepared defence
Whiles the big year swoln with some other grief
Is thought with child by the stern tyrant war
And no such matter Rumour is a pipe
Blown by surmises jealousies conjectures
And of so easy and so plain a stop
That the blunt monster with uncounted heads
The stilldiscordant wavring multitude
Can play upon it But what need I thus
My wellknown body to anatomize
Among my household Why is Rumour here
I run before King Harrys victory
Who in a bloody field by Shrewsbury
Hath beaten down young Hotspur and his troops
Quenching the flame of bold rebellion
Even with the rebels blood But what mean I
To speak so true at first My office is
To noise abroad that Harry Monmouth fell
Under the wrath of noble Hotspurs sword
And that the King before the Douglas rage
Stoopd his anointed head as low as death
This have I rumourd through the peasant towns
Between that royal field of Shrewsbury
And this wormeaten hold of ragged stone
Where Hotspurs father old Northumberland
Lies craftysick The posts come tiring on
And not a man of them brings other news
Than they have learnt of me From Rumours tongues
They bring smooth comforts false worse than true wrongs

Exit




ACT I

SCENE I The same

Enter Lord Bardolph

LORD BARDOLPH
Who keeps the gate here ho

The Porter opens the gate

Where is the Earl

PORTER
What shall I say you are

LORD BARDOLPH
Tell thou the Earl
That the Lord Bardolph doth attend him here

PORTER
His lordship is walkd forth into the orchard
Please it your honour knock but at the gate
And he himself will answer

Enter Northumberland

LORD BARDOLPH
Here comes the Earl

Exit Porter

NORTHUMBERLAND
What news Lord Bardolph Every minute now
Should be the father of some stratagem
The times are wild contention like a horse
Full of high feeding madly hath broke loose
And bears down all before him

LORD BARDOLPH
Noble earl
I bring you certain news from Shrewsbury

NORTHUMBERLAND
Good an God will

LORD BARDOLPH
As good as heart can wish
The King is almost wounded to the death
And in the fortune of my lord your son
Prince Harry slain outright and both the Blunts
Killd by the hand of Douglas young Prince John
And Westmoreland and Stafford fled the field
And Harry Monmouths brawn the hulk Sir John
Is prisoner to your son O such a day
So fought so followd and so fairly won
Came not till now to dignify the times
Since Caesars fortunes

NORTHUMBERLAND
How is this derived
Saw you the field Came you from Shrewsbury

LORD BARDOLPH
I spake with one my lord that came from thence
A gentleman well bred and of good name
That freely renderd me these news for true

NORTHUMBERLAND
Here comes my servant Travers whom I sent
On Tuesday last to listen after news

Enter Travers

LORD BARDOLPH
My lord I overrode him on the way
And he is furnishd with no certainties
More than he haply may retail from me

NORTHUMBERLAND
Now Travers what good tidings comes with you

TRAVERS
My lord Sir John Umfrevile turnd me back
With joyful tidings and being better horsed
Outrode me After him came spurring hard
A gentleman almost forspent with speed
That stoppd by me to breathe his bloodied horse
He askd the way to Chester and of him
I did demand what news from Shrewsbury
He told me that rebellion had bad luck
And that young Harry Percys spur was cold
With that he gave his able horse the head
And bending forward struck his armed heels
Against the panting sides of his poor jade
Up to the rowelhead and starting so
He seemd in running to devour the way
Staying no longer question

NORTHUMBERLAND
Ha Again
Said he young Harry Percys spur was cold
Of Hotspur Coldspur That rebellion
Had met ill luck

LORD BARDOLPH
My lord Ill tell you what
If my young lord your son have not the day
Upon mine honour for a silken point
Ill give my barony never talk of it

NORTHUMBERLAND
Why should that gentleman that rode by Travers
Give then such instances of loss

LORD BARDOLPH
Who he
He was some hilding fellow that had stolen
The horse he rode on and upon my life
Spoke at a venture Look here comes more news

Enter Morton

NORTHUMBERLAND
Yea this mans brow like to a titleleaf
Foretells the nature of a tragic volume
So looks the strand whereon the imperious flood
Hath left a witnessd usurpation
Say Morton didst thou come from Shrewsbury

MORTON
I ran from Shrewsbury my noble lord
Where hateful death put on his ugliest mask
To fright our party

NORTHUMBERLAND
How doth my son and brother
Thou tremblest and the whiteness in thy cheek
Is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand
Even such a man so faint so spiritless
So dull so dread in look so woebegone
Drew Priams curtain in the dead of night
And would have told him half his Troy was burnt
But Priam found the fire ere he his tongue
And I my Percys death ere thou reportst it
This thou wouldst say Your son did thus and thus
Your brother thus so fought the noble Douglas
Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds
But in the end to stop my ear indeed
Thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise
Ending with Brother son and all are dead

MORTON
Douglas is living and your brother yet
But for my lord your son

NORTHUMBERLAND
Why he is dead
See what a ready tongue suspicion hath
He that but fears the thing he would not know
Hath by instinct knowledge from others eyes
That what he feard is chanced Yet speak Morton
Tell thou an earl his divination lies
And I will take it as a sweet disgrace
And make thee rich for doing me such wrong

MORTON
You are too great to be by me gainsaid
Your spirit is too true your fears too certain

NORTHUMBERLAND
Yet for all this say not that Percys dead
I see a strange confession in thine eye
Thou shakest thy head and holdst it fear or sin
To speak a truth If he be slain say so
The tongue offends not that reports his death
And he doth sin that doth belie the dead
Not he which says the dead is not alive
Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news
Hath but a losing office and his tongue
Sounds ever after as a sullen bell
Rememberd tolling a departing friend

LORD BARDOLPH
I cannot think my lord your son is dead

MORTON
I am sorry I should force you to believe
That which I would to God I had not seen
But these mine eyes saw him in bloody state
Rendring faint quittance wearied and outbreathed
To Harry Monmouth whose swift wrath beat down
The neverdaunted Percy to the earth
From whence with life he never more sprung up
In few his death whose spirit lent a fire
Even to the dullest peasant in his camp
Being bruited once took fire and heat away
From the besttemperd courage in his troops
For from his metal was his party steeld
Which once in him abated all the rest
Turnd on themselves like dull and heavy lead
And as the thing thats heavy in itself
Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed
So did our men heavy in Hotspurs loss
Lend to this weight such lightness with their fear
That arrows fled not swifter toward their aim
Than did our soldiers aiming at their safety
Fly from the field Then was that noble Worcester
Too soon taen prisoner and that furious Scot
The bloody Douglas whose welllabouring sword
Had three times slain th appearance of the King
Gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame
Of those that turnd their backs and in his flight
Stumbling in fear was took The sum of all
Is that the King hath won and hath sent out
A speedy power to encounter you my lord
Under the conduct of young Lancaster
And Westmoreland This is the news at full

NORTHUMBERLAND
For this I shall have time enough to mourn
In poison there is physic and these news
Having been well that would have made me sick
Being sick have in some measure made me well
And as the wretch whose feverweakend joints
Like strengthless hinges buckle under life
Impatient of his fit breaks like a fire
Out of his keepers arms even so my limbs
Weakend with grief being now enraged with grief
Are thrice themselves Hence therefore thou nice crutch
A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel
Must glove this hand And hence thou sickly coif
Thou art a guard too wanton for the head
Which princes fleshd with conquest aim to hit
Now bind my brows with iron and approach
The raggedst hour that time and spite dare bring
To frown upon th enraged Northumberland
Let heaven kiss earth Now let not Natures hand
Keep the wild flood confined Let order die
And let this world no longer be a stage
To feed contention in a lingering act
But let one spirit of the firstborn Cain
Reign in all bosoms that each heart being set
On bloody courses the rude scene may end
And darkness be the burier of the dead

LORD BARDOLPH
This strained passion doth you wrong my lord

MORTON
Sweet earl divorce not wisdom from your honour
The lives of all your loving complices
Lean on your health the which if you give oer
To stormy passion must perforce decay
You cast th event of war my noble lord
And summd the account of chance before you said
Let us make head It was your presurmise
That in the dole of blows your son might drop
You knew he walkd oer perils on an edge
More likely to fall in than to get oer
You were advised his flesh was capable
Of wounds and scars and that his forward spirit
Would lift him where most trade of danger ranged
Yet did you say Go forth and none of this
Though strongly apprehended could restrain
The stiffborne action What hath then befalln
Or what hath this bold enterprise brought forth
More than that being which was like to be

LORD BARDOLPH
We all that are engaged to this loss
Knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas
That if we wrought out life twas ten to one
And yet we ventured for the gain proposed
Choked the respect of likely peril feard
And since we are oerset venture again
Come we will put forth body and goods

MORTON
Tis more than time And my most noble lord
I hear for certain and dare speak the truth
The gentle Archbishop of York is up
With wellappointed powers He is a man
Who with a double surety binds his followers
My lord your son had only but the corpse
But shadows and the shows of men to fight
For that same word rebellion did divide
The action of their bodies from their souls
And they did fight with queasiness constraind
As men drink potions that their weapons only
Seemd on our side but for their spirits and souls
This word rebellion it had froze them up
As fish are in a pond But now the bishop
Turns insurrection to religion
Supposed sincere and holy in his thoughts
Hes followd both with body and with mind
And doth enlarge his rising with the blood
Of fair King Richard scraped from Pomfret stones
Derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause
Tells them he doth bestride a bleeding land
Gasping for life under great Bolingbroke
And more and less do flock to follow him

NORTHUMBERLAND
I knew of this before but to speak truth
This present grief had wiped it from my mind
Go in with me and counsel every man
The aptest way for safety and revenge
Get posts and letters and make friends with speed
Never so few and never yet more need

Exeunt

SCENE II London A street

Enter Falstaff with his Page bearing his sword and buckler

FALSTAFF
Sirrah you giant what says the doctor to my water

PAGE
He said sir the water itself was a good healthy water but for the
party that owed it he might have moe diseases than he knew for

FALSTAFF
Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me The brain of this
foolishcompounded clay man is not able to invent anything that tends
to laughter more than I invent or is invented on me I am not only
witty in myself but the cause that wit is in other men I do here walk
before thee like a sow that hath overwhelmed all her litter but one If
the Prince put thee into my service for any other reason than to set me
off why then I have no judgement Thou whoreson mandrake thou art
fitter to be worn in my cap than to wait at my heels I was never
manned with an agate till now but I will inset you neither in gold nor
silver but in vile apparel and send you back again to your master
for a jewelthe juvenal the Prince your master whose chin is not yet
fledge I will sooner have a beard grow in the palm of my hand than he
shall get one off his cheek and yet he will not stick to say his face
is a faceroyal God may finish it when He will tis not a hair amiss
yet He may keep it still at a faceroyal for a barber shall never
earn sixpence out of it And yet hell be crowing as if he had writ man
ever since his father was a bachelor He may keep his own grace but
hes almost out of mine I can assure him What said Master Dommelton
about the satin for my short cloak and my slops

PAGE
He said sir you should procure him better assurance than Bardolph He
would not take his band and yours he liked not the security

FALSTAFF
Let him be damned like the glutton Pray God his tongue be hotter A
whoreson Achitophel A rascally yeaforsooth knave to bear a gentleman
in hand and then stand upon security The whoreson smoothpates do now
wear nothing but high shoes and bunches of keys at their girdles and
if a man is through with them in honest taking up then they must stand
upon security I had as lief they would put ratsbane in my mouth as
offer to stop it with security I looked he should have sent me two and
twenty yards of satin as I am a true knight and he sends me
security Well he may sleep in security for he hath the horn of
abundance and the lightness of his wife shines through it and yet
cannot he see though he have his own lanthorn to light him Wheres
Bardolph

PAGE
Hes gone into Smithfield to buy your worship a horse

FALSTAFF
I bought him in Pauls and hell buy me a horse in Smithfield An I
could get me but a wife in the stews I were manned horsed and wived

Enter the Lord Chief Justice and Servant

PAGE
Sir here comes the nobleman that committed the Prince for striking him
about Bardolph

FALSTAFF
Wait close I will not see him

CHIEF JUSTICE
Whats he that goes there

SERVANT
Falstaff an t please your lordship

CHIEF JUSTICE
He that was in question for the robbery

SERVANT
He my lord but he hath since done good service at Shrewsbury and as
I hear is now going with some charge to the Lord John of Lancaster

CHIEF JUSTICE
What to York Call him back again

SERVANT
Sir John Falstaff

FALSTAFF
Boy tell him I am deaf

PAGE
You must speak louder my master is deaf

CHIEF JUSTICE
I am sure he is to the hearing of anything good
Go pluck him by the elbow I must speak with him

SERVANT
Sir John

FALSTAFF
What A young knave and begging Is there not wars Is there not
employment Doth not the King lack subjects Do not the rebels need
soldiers Though it be a shame to be on any side but one it is worse
shame to beg than to be on the worst side were it worse than the name
of rebellion can tell how to make it

SERVANT
You mistake me sir

FALSTAFF
Why sir did I say you were an honest man Setting my knighthood and
my soldiership aside I had lied in my throat if I had said so

SERVANT
I pray you sir then set your knighthood and your soldiership aside
and give me leave to tell you you lie in your throat if you say I am
any other than an honest man

FALSTAFF
I give thee leave to tell me so I lay aside that which grows to me If
thou getst any leave of me hang me if thou takst leave thou wert
better be hanged You hunt counter Hence Avaunt

SERVANT
Sir my lord would speak with you

CHIEF JUSTICE
Sir John Falstaff a word with you

FALSTAFF
My good lord God give your lordship good time of day I am glad to see
your lordship abroad I heard say your lordship was sick I hope your
lordship goes abroad by advice Your lordship though not clean past
your youth hath yet some smack of age in you some relish of the
saltness of time and I most humbly beseech your lordship to have a
reverend care of your health

CHIEF JUSTICE
Sir John I sent for you before your expedition to Shrewsbury

FALSTAFF
An t please your lordship I hear his Majesty is returned with some
discomfort from Wales

CHIEF JUSTICE
I talk not of his Majesty You would not come when I sent for you

FALSTAFF
And I hear moreover his Highness is fallen into this same whoreson
apoplexy

CHIEF JUSTICE
Well God mend him I pray you let me speak with you

FALSTAFF
This apoplexy as I take it is a kind of lethargy an t please your
lordship a kind of sleeping in the blood a whoreson tingling

CHIEF JUSTICE
What tell you me of it Be it as it is

FALSTAFF
It hath it original from much grief from study and perturbation of the
brain I have read the cause of his effects in Galen It is a kind of
deafness

CHIEF JUSTICE
I think you are fallen into the disease for you hear not what I say to
you

FALSTAFF
Very well my lord very well Rather an t please you it is the
disease of not listening the malady of not marking that I am troubled
withal

CHIEF JUSTICE
To punish you by the heels would amend the attention of your ears and
I care not if I do become your physician

FALSTAFF
I am as poor as Job my lord but not so patient Your lordship may
minister the potion of imprisonment to me in respect of poverty but
how I should be your patient to follow your prescriptions the wise may
make some dram of a scruple or indeed a scruple itself

CHIEF JUSTICE
I sent for you when there were matters against you for your life to
come speak with me

FALSTAFF
As I was then advised by my learned counsel in the laws of this
landservice I did not come

CHIEF JUSTICE
Well the truth is Sir John you live in great infamy

FALSTAFF
He that buckles himself in my belt cannot live in less

CHIEF JUSTICE
Your means are very slender and your waste is great

FALSTAFF
I would it were otherwise I would my means were greater and my waist
slenderer

CHIEF JUSTICE
You have misled the youthful prince

FALSTAFF
The young prince hath misled me I am the fellow with the great belly
and he my dog

CHIEF JUSTICE
Well I am loath to gall a newhealed wound Your days service at
Shrewsbury hath a little gilded over your nights exploit on Gads
Hill You may thank th unquiet time for your quiet oerposting that
action

FALSTAFF
My lord

CHIEF JUSTICE
But since all is well keep it so wake not a sleeping wolf

FALSTAFF
To wake a wolf is as bad as smell a fox

CHIEF JUSTICE
What You are as a candle the better part burnt out

FALSTAFF
A wassail candle my lord all tallow If I did say of wax my growth
would approve the truth

CHIEF JUSTICE
There is not a white hair in your face but should have his effect of
gravity

FALSTAFF
His effect of gravy gravy gravy

CHIEF JUSTICE
You follow the young prince up and down like his ill angel

FALSTAFF
Not so my lord your ill angel is light but I hope he that looks upon
me will take me without weighing And yet in some respects I grant I
cannot go I cannot tell Virtue is of so little regard in these
costermongers times that true valour is turned bearherd pregnancy is
made a tapster and hath his quick wit wasted in giving reckonings All
the other gifts appertinent to man as the malice of this age shapes
them are not worth a gooseberry You that are old consider not the
capacities of us that are young you do measure the heat of our livers
with the bitterness of your galls and we that are in the vaward of our
youth I must confess are wags too

CHIEF JUSTICE
Do you set down your name in the scroll of youth that are written down
old with all the characters of age Have you not a moist eye a dry
hand a yellow cheek a white beard a decreasing leg an increasing
belly Is not your voice broken your wind short your chin double
your wit single and every part about you blasted with antiquity And
will you yet call yourself young Fie fie fie Sir John

FALSTAFF
My lord I was born about three of the clock in the afternoon with a
white head and something a round belly For my voice I have lost it
with halloing and singing of anthems To approve my youth further I
will not The truth is I am only old in judgement and understanding
and he that will caper with me for a thousand marks let him lend me
the money and have at him For the box of the ear that the Prince gave
you he gave it like a rude prince and you took it like a sensible
lord I have checked him for it and the young lion repents Marry not
in ashes and sackcloth but in new silk and old sack

CHIEF JUSTICE
Well God send the Prince a better companion

FALSTAFF
God send the companion a better prince I cannot rid my hands of him

CHIEF JUSTICE
Well the King hath severed you and Prince Harry I hear you are going
with Lord John of Lancaster against the Archbishop and the Earl of
Northumberland

FALSTAFF
Yea I thank your pretty sweet wit for it But look you pray all you
that kiss my lady Peace at home that our armies join not in a hot day
for by the Lord I take but two shirts out with me and I mean not to
sweat extraordinarily If it be a hot day and I brandish anything but
a bottle I would I might never spit white again There is not a
dangerous action can peep out his head but I am thrust upon it Well I
cannot last ever But it was alway yet the trick of our English nation
if they have a good thing to make it too common If ye will needs say
I am an old man you should give me rest I would to God my name were
not so terrible to the enemy as it is I were better to be eaten to
death with a rust than to be scoured to nothing with perpetual motion

CHIEF JUSTICE
Well be honest be honest and God bless your expedition

FALSTAFF
Will your lordship lend me a thousand pound to furnish me forth

CHIEF JUSTICE
Not a penny not a penny you are too impatient to bear crosses Fare
you well commend me to my cousin Westmoreland

Exeunt Chief Justice and Servant

FALSTAFF
If I do fillip me with a threeman beetle A man can no more separate
age and covetousness than he can part young limbs and lechery but the
gout galls the one and the pox pinches the other and so both the
degrees prevent my curses Boy

PAGE
Sir

FALSTAFF
What money is in my purse

PAGE
Seven groats and two pence

FALSTAFF
I can get no remedy against this consumption of the purse Borrowing
only lingers and lingers it out but the disease is incurable Go bear
this letter to my Lord of Lancaster this to the Prince this to the
Earl of Westmoreland and this to old Mistress Ursula whom I have
weekly sworn to marry since I perceived the first white hair of my
chin About it You know where to find me Exit Page A pox of this
gout or a gout of this pox for the one or the other plays the rogue
with my great toe Tis no matter if I do halt I have the wars for my
colour and my pension shall seem the more reasonable A good wit will
make use of anything I will turn diseases to commodity

Exit

SCENE III York The Archbishops palace

Enter the Archbishop the Lords Hastings Mowbray and Bardolph

ARCHBISHOP
Thus have you heard our cause and known our means
And my most noble friends I pray you all
Speak plainly your opinions of our hopes
And first Lord Marshal what say you to it

MOWBRAY
I well allow the occasion of our arms
But gladly would be better satisfied
How in our means we should advance ourselves
To look with forehead bold and big enough
Upon the power and puissance of the King

HASTINGS
Our present musters grow upon the file
To five and twenty thousand men of choice
And our supplies live largely in the hope
Of great Northumberland whose bosom burns
With an incensed fire of injuries

LORD BARDOLPH
The question then Lord Hastings standeth thus
Whether our present five and twenty thousand
May hold up head without Northumberland

HASTINGS
With him we may

LORD BARDOLPH
Yea marry theres the point
But if without him we be thought too feeble
My judgement is we should not step too far
Till we had his assistance by the hand
For in a theme so bloodyfaced as this
Conjecture expectation and surmise
Of aids incertain should not be admitted

ARCHBISHOP
Tis very true Lord Bardolph for indeed
It was young Hotspurs case at Shrewsbury

LORD BARDOLPH
It was my lord who lined himself with hope
Eating the air on promise of supply
Flattring himself in project of a power
Much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts
And so with great imagination
Proper to madmen led his powers to death
And winking leapd into destruction

HASTINGS
But by your leave it never yet did hurt
To lay down likelihoods and forms of hope

LORD BARDOLPH
Yes if this present quality of war
Indeed the instant action a cause on foot
Lives so in hope as in an early spring
We see th appearing buds which to prove fruit
Hope gives not so much warrant as despair
That frosts will bite them When we mean to build
We first survey the plot then draw the model
And when we see the figure of the house
Then we must rate the cost of the erection
Which if we find outweighs ability
What do we then but draw anew the model
In fewer offices or at least desist
To build at all Much more in this great work
Which is almost to pluck a kingdom down
And set another up should we survey
The plot of situation and the model
Consent upon a sure foundation
Question surveyors know our own estate
How able such a work to undergo
To weigh against his opposite or else
We fortify in paper and in figures
Using the names of men instead of men
Like one that draws the model of a house
Beyond his power to build it who half through
Gives oer and leaves his partcreated cost
A naked subject to the weeping clouds
And waste for churlish winters tyranny

HASTINGS
Grant that our hopes yet likely of fair birth
Should be stillborn and that we now possessd
The utmost man of expectation
I think we are a body strong enough
Even as we are to equal with the King

LORD BARDOLPH
What is the King but five and twenty thousand

HASTINGS
To us no more nay not so much Lord Bardolph
For his divisions as the times do brawl
Are in three heads one power against the French
And one against Glendower perforce a third
Must take up us So is the unfirm king
In three divided and his coffers sound
With hollow poverty and emptiness

ARCHBISHOP
That he should draw his several strengths together
And come against us in full puissance
Need not be dreaded

HASTINGS
If he should do so
He leaves his back unarmd the French and Welsh
Baying him at the heels never fear that

LORD BARDOLPH
Who is it like should lead his forces hither

HASTINGS
The Duke of Lancaster and Westmoreland
Against the Welsh himself and Harry Monmouth
But who is substituted gainst the French
I have no certain notice

ARCHBISHOP
Let us on
And publish the occasion of our arms
The commonwealth is sick of their own choice
Their overgreedy love hath surfeited
An habitation giddy and unsure
Hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart
O thou fond many with what loud applause
Didst thou beat heaven with blessing Bolingbroke
Before he was what thou wouldst have him be
And being now trimmd in thine own desires
Thou beastly feeder art so full of him
That thou provokst thyself to cast him up
So so thou common dog didst thou disgorge
Thy glutton bosom of the royal Richard
And now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up
And howlst to find it What trust is in these times
They that when Richard lived would have him die
Are now become enamourd on his grave
Thou that threwst dust upon his goodly head
When through proud London he came sighing on
After th admired heels of Bolingbroke
Criest now O earth yield us that king again
And take thou this O thoughts of men accursed
Past and to come seems best things present worst

MOWBRAY
Shall we go draw our numbers and set on

HASTINGS
We are times subjects and time bids be gone

Exeunt

SCENE II London Another street

Enter Prince Henry and Poins

PRINCE
Before God I am exceeding weary

POINS
Is t come to that I had thought weariness durst not have attached one
of so high blood

PRINCE
Faith it does me though it discolours the complexion of my greatness
to acknowledge it Doth it not show vilely in me to desire small beer

POINS
Why a prince should not be so loosely studied as to remember so weak a
composition

PRINCE
Belike then my appetite was not princely got for by my troth I do
now remember the poor creature small beer But indeed these humble
considerations make me out of love with my greatness What a disgrace
is it to me to remember thy name or to know thy face tomorrow or to
take note how many pair of silk stockings thou hastviz these and
those that were thy peachcoloured ones or to bear the inventory of
thy shirts as one for superfluity and another for use But that the
tenniscourt keeper knows better than I for it is a low ebb of linen
with thee when thou keepest not racket there as thou hast not done a
great while because the rest of thy low countries have made a shift to
eat up thy holland And God knows whether those that bawl out of the
ruins of thy linen shall inherit his kingdom but the midwives say the
children are not in the fault whereupon the world increases and
kindreds are mightily strengthened

POINS
How ill it follows after you have laboured so hard you should talk so
idly Tell me how many good young princes would do so their fathers
being so sick as yours at this time is

PRINCE
Shall I tell thee one thing Poins

POINS
Yes faith and let it be an excellent good thing

PRINCE
It shall serve among wits of no higher breeding than thine

POINS
Go to I stand the push of your one thing that you will tell

PRINCE
Marry I tell thee it is not meet that I should be sad now my father
is sick albeit I could tell to thee as to one it pleases me for
fault of a better to call my friend I could be sad and sad indeed
too

POINS
Very hardly upon such a subject

PRINCE
By this hand thou thinkest me as far in the devils book as thou and
Falstaff for obduracy and persistency Let the end try the man But I
tell thee my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is so sick and
keeping such vile company as thou art hath in reason taken from me all
ostentation of sorrow

POINS
The reason

PRINCE
What wouldst thou think of me if I should weep

POINS
I would think thee a most princely hypocrite

PRINCE
It would be every mans thought and thou art a blessed fellow to think
as every man thinks Never a mans thought in the world keeps the
roadway better than thine every man would think me an hypocrite
indeed And what accites your most worshipful thought to think so

POINS
Why because you have been so lewd and so much engraffed to Falstaff

PRINCE
And to thee

POINS
By this light I am well spoke on I can hear it with mine own ears
The worst that they can say of me is that I am a second brother and
that I am a proper fellow of my hands and those two things I confess
I cannot help By the mass here comes Bardolph

Enter Bardolph and Page

PRINCE
And the boy that I gave Falstaff He had him from me Christian and
look if the fat villain have not transformed him ape

BARDOLPH
God save your Grace

PRINCE
And yours most noble Bardolph

POINS
Come you virtuous ass you bashful fool must you be blushing
Wherefore blush you now What a maidenly manatarms are you become Is
t such a matter to get a pottlepots maidenhead

PAGE
He calls me een now my lord through a red lattice and I could
discern no part of his face from the window At last I spied his eyes
and methought he had made two holes in the alewifes new petticoat and
so peeped through

PRINCE
Has not the boy profited

BARDOLPH
Away you whoreson upright rabbit away

PAGE
Away you rascally Althaeas dream away

PRINCE
Instruct us boy what dream boy

PAGE
Marry my lord Althaea dreamt she was delivered of a firebrand and
therefore I call him her dream

PRINCE
A crowns worth of good interpretation There tis boy

POINS
O that this blossom could be kept from cankers Well there is
sixpence to preserve thee

BARDOLPH
An you do not make him be hanged among you the gallows shall have
wrong

PRINCE
And how doth thy master Bardolph

BARDOLPH
Well my lord He heard of your Graces coming to town Theres a
letter for you

POINS
Delivered with good respect And how doth the martlemas your master

BARDOLPH
In bodily health sir

POINS
Marry the immortal part needs a physician but that moves not him
Though that be sick it dies not

PRINCE
I do allow this wen to be as familiar with me as my dog and he holds
his place for look you how he writes

POINS
Reads John Falstaff knight Every man must know that as oft as
he has occasion to name himself even like those that are kin to the
King for they never prick their finger but they say Theres some of
the Kings blood spilt How comes that says he that takes upon him
not to conceive The answer is as ready as a borrowers cap I am the
Kings poor cousin sir

PRINCE
Nay they will be kin to us or they will fetch it from Japhet But to
the letter Sir John Falstaff knight to the son of the King nearest
his father Harry Prince of Wales greeting

POINS
Why this is a certificate

PRINCE
Peace I will imitate the honourable Romans in brevity

POINS
He sure means brevity in breath shortwinded

PRINCE
I commend me to thee I commend thee and I leave thee Be not too
familiar with Poins for he misuses thy favours so much that he swears
thou art to marry his sister Nell Repent at idle times as thou mayst
and so farewell
Thine by yea and no which is as much as to say as thou usest himJack
Falstaff with my familiars John with my brothers and sisters and Sir
John with all Europe

POINS
My lord Ill steep this letter in sack and make him eat it

PRINCE
Thats to make him eat twenty of his words But do you use me thus
Ned Must I marry your sister

POINS
God send the wench no worse fortune But I never said so

PRINCE
Well thus we play the fools with the time and the spirits of the wise
sit in the clouds and mock us Is your master here in London

BARDOLPH
Yea my lord

PRINCE
Where sups he Doth the old boar feed in the old frank

PAGE
Ephesians my lord of the old church

PRINCE
Sup any women with him

PAGE
None my lord but old Mistress Quickly and Mistress Doll Tearsheet

PRINCE
What pagan may that be

PAGE
A proper gentlewoman sir and a kinswoman of my masters

PRINCE
Even such kin as the parish heifers are to the town bull Shall we
steal upon them Ned at supper

POINS
I am your shadow my lord Ill follow you

PRINCE
Sirrah you boy and Bardolph no word to your master that I am yet
come to town Theres for your silence

BARDOLPH
I have no tongue sir

PAGE
And for mine sir I will govern it

PRINCE
Fare you well go

Exeunt Bardolph and Page

This Doll Tearsheet should be some road

POINS
I warrant you as common as the way between Saint Albans and London

PRINCE
How might we see Falstaff bestow himself tonight in his true colours
and not ourselves be seen

POINS
Put on two leathern jerkins and aprons and wait upon him at his table
as drawers

PRINCE
From a god to a bull A heavy descension It was Joves case From a
prince to a prentice A low transformation that shall be mine for in
everything the purpose must weigh with the folly Follow me Ned

Exeunt

SCENE III Warkworth Before the castle

Enter Northumberland Lady Northumberland and Lady Percy

NORTHUMBERLAND
I pray thee loving wife and gentle daughter
Give even way unto my rough affairs
Put not you on the visage of the times
And be like them to Percy troublesome

LADY NORTHUMBERLAND
I have given over I will speak no more
Do what you will your wisdom be your guide

NORTHUMBERLAND
Alas sweet wife my honour is at pawn
And but my going nothing can redeem it

LADY PERCY
O yet for Gods sake go not to these wars
The time was father that you broke your word
When you were more endeard to it than now
When your own Percy when my hearts dear Harry
Threw many a northward look to see his father
Bring up his powers but he did long in vain
Who then persuaded you to stay at home
There were two honours lost yours and your sons
For yours the God of heaven brighten it
For his it stuck upon him as the sun
In the grey vault of heaven and by his light
Did all the chivalry of England move
To do brave acts He was indeed the glass
Wherein the noble youth did dress themselves
He had no legs that practisd not his gait
And speaking thick which nature made his blemish
Became the accents of the valiant
For those who could speak low and tardily
Would turn their own perfection to abuse
To seem like him So that in speech in gait
In diet in affections of delight
In military rules humours of blood
He was the mark and glass copy and book
That fashiond others And himO wondrous him
O miracle of menhim did you leave
Second to none unseconded by you
To look upon the hideous god of war
In disadvantage to abide a field
Where nothing but the sound of Hotspurs name
Did seem defensible so you left him
Never O never do his ghost the wrong
To hold your honour more precise and nice
With others than with him Let them alone
The Marshal and the Archbishop are strong
Had my sweet Harry had but half their numbers
Today might I hanging on Hotspurs neck
Have talkd of Monmouths grave

NORTHUMBERLAND
Beshrew your heart
Fair daughter you do draw my spirits from me
With new lamenting ancient oversights
But I must go and meet with danger there
Or it will seek me in another place
And find me worse provided

LADY NORTHUMBERLAND
O fly to Scotland
Till that the nobles and the armed commons
Have of their puissance made a little taste

LADY PERCY
If they get ground and vantage of the King
Then join you with them like a rib of steel
To make strength stronger but for all our loves
First let them try themselves So did your son
He was so sufferd So came I a widow
And never shall have length of life enough
To rain upon remembrance with mine eyes
That it may grow and sprout as high as heaven
For recordation to my noble husband

NORTHUMBERLAND
Come come go in with me Tis with my mind
As with the tide swelld up unto his height
That makes a stillstand running neither way
Fain would I go to meet the Archbishop
But many thousand reasons hold me back
I will resolve for Scotland There am I
Till time and vantage crave my company

flapdragons and rides the wild mare with the boys and jumps upon
joint stools and swears with a good grace and wears his boots very
smooth like unto the sign of the Leg and breeds no bate with telling

ACT III

SCENE I Westminster The palace

Enter the King in his nightgown with a Page

KING
Go call the Earls of Surrey and of Warwick
But ere they come bid them oerread these letters
And well consider of them Make good speed

Exit Page

How many thousands of my poorest subjects
Are at this hour asleep O sleep O gentle sleep
Natures soft nurse how have I frighted thee
That thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids down
And steep my senses in forgetfulness
Why rather sleep liest thou in smoky cribs
Upon uneasy pallets stretching thee
And hushed with buzzing nightflies to thy slumber
Than in the perfumed chambers of the great
Under the canopies of costly state
And lulld with sound of sweetest melody
O thou dull god why liest thou with the vile
In loathsome beds and leavest the kingly couch
A watchcase or a common larumbell
Wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast
Seal up the shipboys eyes and rock his brains
In cradle of the rude imperious surge
And in the visitation of the winds
Who take the ruffian billows by the top
Curling their monstrous heads and hanging them
With deafing clamour in the slippery clouds
That with the hurly death itself awakes
Canst thou O partial sleep give thy repose
To the wet seaboy in an hour so rude
And in the calmest and most stillest night
With all appliances and means to boot
Deny it to a King Then happy low lie down
Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown

Enter Warwick and Surrey

WARWICK
Many good morrows to your Majesty

KING
Is it good morrow lords

WARWICK
Tis one oclock and past

KING
Why then good morrow to you all my lords
Have you read oer the letters that I sent you

WARWICK
We have my liege

KING
Then you perceive the body of our kingdom
How foul it is what rank diseases grow
And with what danger near the heart of it

WARWICK
It is but as a body yet distemperd
Which to his former strength may be restored
With good advice and little medicine
My Lord Northumberland will soon be coold

KING
O God that one might read the book of fate
And see the revolution of the times
Make mountains level and the continent
Weary of solid firmness melt itself
Into the sea and other times to see
The beachy girdle of the ocean
Too wide for Neptunes hips how chances mocks
And changes fill the cup of alteration
With divers liquors O if this were seen
The happiest youth viewing his progress through
What perils past what crosses to ensue
Would shut the book and sit him down and die
Tis not ten years gone
Since Richard and Northumberland great friends
Did feast together and in two years after
Were they at wars It is but eight years since
This Percy was the man nearest my soul
Who like a brother toild in my affairs
And laid his love and life under my foot
Yea for my sake even to the eyes of Richard
Gave him defiance But which of you was by
To Warwick You cousin Nevil as I may remember
When Richard with his eye brimful of tears
Then checkd and rated by Northumberland
Did speak these words now proved a prophecy
Northumberland thou ladder by the which
My cousin Bolingbroke ascends my throne
Though then God knows I had no such intent
But that necessity so bowd the state
That I and greatness were compelld to kiss
The time shall come thus did he follow it
The time will come that foul sin gathering head
Shall break into corruptionso went on
Foretelling this same times condition
And the division of our amity

WARWICK
There is a history in all mens lives
Figuring the natures of the times deceased
The which observed a man may prophesy
With a near aim of the main chance of things
As yet not come to life who in their seeds
And weak beginning lie intreasured
Such things become the hatch and brood of time
And by the necessary form of this
King Richard might create a perfect guess
That great Northumberland then false to him
Would of that seed grow to a greater falseness
Which should not find a ground to root upon
Unless on you

KING
Are these things then necessities
Then let us meet them like necessities
And that same word even now cries out on us
They say the bishop and Northumberland
Are fifty thousand strong

WARWICK
It cannot be my lord
Rumour doth double like the voice and echo
The numbers of the feared Please it your Grace
To go to bed Upon my soul my lord
The powers that you already have sent forth
Shall bring this prize in very easily
To comfort you the more I have received
A certain instance that Glendower is dead
Your majesty hath been this fortnight ill
And these unseasond hours perforce must add
Unto your sickness

KING
I will take your counsel
And were these inward wars once out of hand
We would dear lords unto the Holy Land

Exeunt

Lord Lord how subject we old men are to this vice of lying This same
starved justice hath done nothing but prate to me of the wildness of
his youth and the feats he hath done about Turnbull Street and every
third word a lie duer paid to the hearer than the Turks tribute I do
remember him at Clements Inn like a man made after supper of a
cheeseparing When he was naked he was for all the world like a
forked radish with a head fantastically carved upon it with a knife
He was so forlorn that his dimensions to any thick sight were
invincible He was the very genius of famine yet lecherous as a
monkey and the whores called him mandrake He came ever in the
rearward of the fashion and sung those tunes to the overscutched
huswives that he heard the carmen whistle and sware they were his
fancies or his goodnights And now is this Vices dagger become a
squire and talks as familiarly of John a Gaunt as if he had been sworn
brother to him and Ill be sworn he neer saw him but once in the
tiltyard and then he burst his head for crowding among the marshals
men I saw it and told John a Gaunt he beat his own name for you might
have thrust him and all his apparel into an eelskin the case of a
treble hautboy was a mansion for him a court And now has he land and
beefs Well Ill be acquainted with him if I return and t shall go
hard but Ill make him a philosophers two stones to me If the young
dace be a bait for the old pike I see no reason in the law of nature
but I may snap at him Let time shape and there an end

ACT IV

SCENE I Yorkshire Gaultree Forest

Enter the Archbishop of York Mowbray Hastings and others

ARCHBISHOP
What is this forest calld

HASTINGS
Tis Gaultree Forest an t shall please your Grace

ARCHBISHOP
Here stand my lords and send discoverers forth
To know the numbers of our enemies

HASTINGS
We have sent forth already

ARCHBISHOP
Tis well done
My friends and brethren in these great affairs
I must acquaint you that I have received
Newdated letters from Northumberland
Their cold intent tenor and substance thus
Here doth he wish his person with such powers
As might hold sortance with his quality
The which he could not levy whereupon
He is retired to ripe his growing fortunes
To Scotland and concludes in hearty prayers
That your attempts may overlive the hazard
And fearful meeting of their opposite

MOWBRAY
Thus do the hopes we have in him touch ground
And dash themselves to pieces

Enter a Messenger

HASTINGS
Now what news

MESSENGER
West of this forest scarcely off a mile
In goodly form comes on the enemy
And by the ground they hide I judge their number
Upon or near the rate of thirty thousand

MOWBRAY
The just proportion that we gave them out
Let us sway on and face them in the field

Enter Westmoreland

ARCHBISHOP
What wellappointed leader fronts us here

MOWBRAY
I think it is my Lord of Westmoreland

WESTMORELAND
Health and fair greeting from our general
The prince Lord John and Duke of Lancaster

ARCHBISHOP
Say on my Lord of Westmoreland in peace
What doth concern your coming

WESTMORELAND
Then my lord
Unto your Grace do I in chief address
The substance of my speech If that rebellion
Came like itself in base and abject routs
Led on by bloody youth guarded with rags
And countenanced by boys and beggary
I say if damnd commotion so appeard
In his true native and most proper shape
You reverend father and these noble lords
Had not been here to dress the ugly form
Of base and bloody insurrection
With your fair honours You Lord Archbishop
Whose see is by a civil peace maintaind
Whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touchd
Whose learning and good letters peace hath tutord
Whose white investments figure innocence
The dove and very blessed spirit of peace
Wherefore you do so ill translate yourself
Out of the speech of peace that bears such grace
Into the harsh and boisterous tongue of war
Turning your books to graves your ink to blood
Your pens to lances and your tongue divine
To a loud trumpet and a point of war

ARCHBISHOP
Wherefore do I this So the question stands
Briefly to this end we are all diseased
And with our surfeiting and wanton hours
Have brought ourselves into a burning fever
And we must bleed for it of which disease
Our late King Richard being infected died
But my most noble Lord of Westmoreland
I take not on me here as a physician
Nor do I as an enemy to peace
Troop in the throngs of military men
But rather show awhile like fearful war
To diet rank minds sick of happiness
And purge th obstructions which begin to stop
Our very veins of life Hear me more plainly
I have in equal balance justly weighd
What wrongs our arms may do what wrongs we suffer
And find our griefs heavier than our offences
We see which way the stream of time doth run
And are enforced from our most quiet there
By the rough torrent of occasion
And have the summary of all our griefs
When time shall serve to show in articles
Which long ere this we offerd to the King
And might by no suit gain our audience
When we are wrongd and would unfold our griefs
We are denied access unto his person
Even by those men that most have done us wrong
The dangers of the days but newly gone
Whose memory is written on the earth
With yetappearing blood and the examples
Of every minutes instance present now
Hath put us in these illbeseeming arms
Not to break peace or any branch of it
But to establish here a peace indeed
Concurring both in name and quality

WESTMORELAND
Whenever yet was your appeal denied
Wherein have you been galled by the King
What peer hath been subornd to grate on you
That you should seal this lawless bloody book
Of forged rebellion with a seal divine
And consecrate commotions bitter edge

ARCHBISHOP
My brother general the commonwealth
To brother born an household cruelty
I make my quarrel in particular

WESTMORELAND
There is no need of any such redress
Or if there were it not belongs to you

MOWBRAY
Why not to him in part and to us all
That feel the bruises of the days before
And suffer the condition of these times
To lay a heavy and unequal hand
Upon our honours

WESTMORELAND
O my good Lord Mowbray
Construe the times to their necessities
And you shall say indeed it is the time
And not the King that doth you injuries
Yet for your part it not appears to me
Either from the King or in the present time
That you should have an inch of any ground
To build a grief on Were you not restored
To all the Duke of Norfolks signories
Your noble and right well remembred fathers

MOWBRAY
What thing in honour had my father lost
That need to be revived and breathed in me
The King that loved him as the state stood then
Was force perforce compelld to banish him
And then that Henry Bolingbroke and he
Being mounted and both roused in their seats
Their neighing coursers daring of the spur
Their armed staves in charge their beavers down
Their eyes of fire sparkling through sights of steel
And the loud trumpet blowing them together
Then then when there was nothing could have stayd
My father from the breast of Bolingbroke
O when the King did throw his warder down
His own life hung upon the staff he threw
Then threw he down himself and all their lives
That by indictment and by dint of sword
Have since miscarried under Bolingbroke

WESTMORELAND
You speak Lord Mowbray now you know not what
The Earl of Hereford was reputed then
In England the most valiant gentleman
Who knows on whom fortune would then have smiled
But if your father had been victor there
He neer had borne it out of Coventry
For all the country in a general voice
Cried hate upon him and all their prayers and love
Were set on Hereford whom they doted on
And blessd and graced indeed more than the King
But this is mere digression from my purpose
Here come I from our princely general
To know your griefs to tell you from his Grace
That he will give you audience and wherein
It shall appear that your demands are just
You shall enjoy them everything set off
That might so much as think you enemies

MOWBRAY
But he hath forcd us to compel this offer
And it proceeds from policy not love

WESTMORELAND
Mowbray you overween to take it so
This offer comes from mercy not from fear
For lo within a ken our army lies
Upon mine honour all too confident
To give admittance to a thought of fear
Our battle is more full of names than yours
Our men more perfect in the use of arms
Our armour all as strong our cause the best
Then reason will our hearts should be as good
Say you not then our offer is compelld

MOWBRAY
Well by my will we shall admit no parley

WESTMORELAND
That argues but the shame of your offence
A rotten case abides no handling

HASTINGS
Hath the Prince John a full commission
In very ample virtue of his father
To hear and absolutely to determine
Of what conditions we shall stand upon

WESTMORELAND
That is intended in the generals name
I muse you make so slight a question

ARCHBISHOP
Then take my Lord of Westmoreland this schedule
For this contains our general grievances
Each several article herein redressd
All members of our cause both here and hence
That are insinewd to this action
Acquitted by a true substantial form
And present execution of our wills
To us and to our purposes confined
We come within our awful banks again
And knit our powers to the arm of peace

WESTMORELAND
This will I show the general Please you lords
In sight of both our battles we may meet
And either end in peace which God so frame
Or to the place of difference call the swords
Which must decide it

ARCHBISHOP
My lord we will do so

Exit Westmoreland

MOWBRAY
There is a thing within my bosom tells me
That no conditions of our peace can stand

HASTINGS
Fear you not that if we can make our peace
Upon such large terms and so absolute
As our conditions shall consist upon
Our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains

MOWBRAY
Yea but our valuation shall be such
That every slight and falsederived cause
Yea every idle nice and wanton reason
Shall to the King taste of this action
That were our royal faiths martyrs in love
We shall be winnowd with so rough a wind
That even our corn shall seem as light as chaff
And good from bad find no partition

ARCHBISHOP
No no my lord Note this the King is weary
Of dainty and such picking grievances
For he hath found to end one doubt by death
Revives two greater in the heirs of life
And therefore will he wipe his tables clean
And keep no telltale to his memory
That may repeat and history his loss
To new remembrance For full well he knows
He cannot so precisely weed this land
As his misdoubts present occasion
His foes are so enrooted with his friends
That plucking to unfix an enemy
He doth unfasten so and shake a friend
So that this land like an offensive wife
That hath enraged him on to offer strokes
As he is striking holds his infant up
And hangs resolved correction in the arm
That was upreard to execution

HASTINGS
Besides the King hath wasted all his rods
On late offenders that he now doth lack
The very instruments of chastisement
So that his power like to a fangless lion
May offer but not hold

ARCHBISHOP
Tis very true
And therefore be assured my good Lord Marshal
If we do now make our atonement well
Our peace will like a broken limb united
Grow stronger for the breaking

MOWBRAY
Be it so
Here is returnd my Lord of Westmoreland

Enter Westmoreland

WESTMORELAND
The prince is here at hand Pleaseth your lordship
To meet his Grace just distance tween our armies

MOWBRAY
Your Grace of York in Gods name then set forward

ARCHBISHOP
Before and greet his Grace My lord we come

Exeunt

SCENE II Another part of the forest

Enter from one side Mowbray attended afterwards the Archbishop
Hastings and others from the other side Prince John of Lancaster
and Westmoreland Officers and others with them

LANCASTER
You are well encounterd here my cousin Mowbray
Good day to you gentle Lord Archbishop
And so to you Lord Hastings and to all
My Lord of York it better showd with you
When that your flock assembled by the bell
Encircled you to hear with reverence
Your exposition on the holy text
Than now to see you here an iron man
Cheering a rout of rebels with your drum
Turning the word to sword and life to death
That man that sits within a monarchs heart
And ripens in the sunshine of his favour
Would he abuse the countenance of the king
Alack what mischiefs might he set abroach
In shadow of such greatness With you Lord Bishop
It is even so Who hath not heard it spoken
How deep you were within the books of God
To us the speaker in his parliament
To us th imagined voice of God himself
The very opener and intelligencer
Between the grace the sanctities of heaven
And our dull workings O who shall believe
But you misuse the reverence of your place
Employ the countenance and grace of heaven
As a false favourite doth his princes name
In deeds dishonourable You have taen up
Under the counterfeited zeal of God
The subjects of his substitute my father
And both against the peace of heaven and him
Have here upswarmd them

ARCHBISHOP
Good my Lord of Lancaster
I am not here against your fathers peace
But as I told my Lord of Westmoreland
The time misorderd doth in common sense
Crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form
To hold our safety up I sent your Grace
The parcels and particulars of our grief
The which hath been with scorn shoved from the court
Whereon this Hydra son of war is born
Whose dangerous eyes may well be charmd asleep
With grant of our most just and right desires
And true obedience of this madness cured
Stoop tamely to the foot of majesty

MOWBRAY
If not we ready are to try our fortunes
To the last man

HASTINGS
And though we here fall down
We have supplies to second our attempt
If they miscarry theirs shall second them
And so success of mischief shall be born
And heir from heir shall hold this quarrel up
Whiles England shall have generation

LANCASTER
You are too shallow Hastings much too shallow
To sound the bottom of the aftertimes

WESTMORELAND
Pleaseth your Grace to answer them directly
How far forth you do like their articles

LANCASTER
I like them all and do allow them well
And swear here by the honour of my blood
My fathers purposes have been mistook
And some about him have too lavishly
Wrested his meaning and authority
My lord these griefs shall be with speed redressd
Upon my soul they shall If this may please you
Discharge your powers unto their several counties
As we will ours and here between the armies
Lets drink together friendly and embrace
That all their eyes may bear those tokens home
Of our restored love and amity

ARCHBISHOP
I take your princely word for these redresses

LANCASTER
I give it you and will maintain my word
And thereupon I drink unto your Grace

HASTINGS
Go captain and deliver to the army
This news of peace Let them have pay and part
I know it will please them Hie thee captain

Exit Officer

ARCHBISHOP
To you my noble Lord of Westmoreland

WESTMORELAND
I pledge your Grace and if you knew what pains
I have bestowd to breed this present peace
You would drink freely but my love to ye
Shall show itself more openly hereafter

ARCHBISHOP
I do not doubt you

WESTMORELAND
I am glad of it
Health to my lord and gentle cousin Mowbray

MOWBRAY
You wish me health in very happy season
For I am on the sudden something ill

ARCHBISHOP
Against ill chances men are ever merry
But heaviness foreruns the good event

WESTMORELAND
Therefore be merry coz since sudden sorrow
Serves to say thus Some good thing comes tomorrow

ARCHBISHOP
Believe me I am passing light in spirit

MOWBRAY
So much the worse if your own rule be true

Shouts within

LANCASTER
The word of peace is renderd Hark how they shout

MOWBRAY
This had been cheerful after victory

ARCHBISHOP
A peace is of the nature of a conquest
For then both parties nobly are subdued
And neither party loser

LANCASTER
Go my lord
And let our army be discharged too

Exit Westmoreland

And good my lord so please you let our trains
March by us that we may peruse the men
We should have coped withal

ARCHBISHOP
Go good Lord Hastings
And ere they be dismissd let them march by

Exit Hastings

LANCASTER
I trust lords we shall lie tonight together

Enter Westmoreland

Now cousin wherefore stands our army still

WESTMORELAND
The leaders having charge from you to stand
Will not go off until they hear you speak

LANCASTER
They know their duties

Enter Hastings

HASTINGS
My lord our army is dispersed already
Like youthful steers unyoked they take their courses
East west north south or like a school broke up
Each hurries toward his home and sportingplace

WESTMORELAND
Good tidings my Lord Hastings for the which
I do arrest thee traitor of high treason
And you Lord Archbishop and you Lord Mowbray
Of capital treason I attach you both

MOWBRAY
Is this proceeding just and honourable

WESTMORELAND
Is your assembly so

ARCHBISHOP
Will you thus break your faith

LANCASTER
I pawnd thee none
I promised you redress of these same grievances
Whereof you did complain which by mine honour
I will perform with a most Christian care
But for you rebels look to taste the due
Meet for rebellion and such acts as yours
Most shallowly did you these arms commence
Fondly brought here and foolishly sent hence
Strike up our drums pursue the scattrd stray
God and not we hath safely fought today
Some guard these traitors to the block of death
Treasons true bed and yielderup of breath

Exeunt

SCENE III Another part of the forest

Alarum Excursions Enter Falstaff and Colevile meeting

FALSTAFF
Whats your name sir Of what condition are you and of what place I

COLEVILE
I am a knight sir and my name is Colevile of the Dale

FALSTAFF
Well then Colevile is your name a knight is your degree and your
place the Dale Colevile shall be still your name a traitor your
degree and the dungeon your place a place deep enough so shall you
be still Colevile of the Dale

COLEVILE
Are not you Sir John Falstaff

FALSTAFF
As good a man as he sir whoeer I am Do ye yield sir or shall I
sweat for you If I do sweat they are the drops of thy lovers and
they weep for thy death Therefore rouse up fear and trembling and do
observance to my mercy

COLEVILE
I think you are Sir John Falstaff and in that thought yield me

FALSTAFF
I have a whole school of tongues in this belly of mine and not a
tongue of them all speaks any other word but my name An I had but a
belly of any indifferency I were simply the most active fellow in
Europe My womb my womb my womb undoes me Here comes our general

Enter Prince John of Lancaster Westmoreland Blunt and others

LANCASTER
The heat is past follow no further now
Call in the powers good cousin Westmoreland

Exit Westmoreland

Now Falstaff where have you been all this while
When everything is ended then you come
These tardy tricks of yours will on my life
One time or other break some gallows back

FALSTAFF
I would be sorry my lord but it should be thus I never knew yet but
rebuke and check was the reward of valour Do you think me a swallow
an arrow or a bullet Have I in my poor and old motion the
expedition of thought I have speeded hither with the very extremest
inch of possibility I have foundered nine score and odd posts and
here traveltainted as I am have in my pure and immaculate valour
taken Sir John Colevile of the Dale a most furious knight and valorous
enemy But what of that He saw me and yielded that I may justly say
with the hooknosed fellow of Rome I came saw and overcame

LANCASTER
It was more of his courtesy than your deserving

FALSTAFF
I know not Here he is and here I yield him And I beseech your Grace
let it be booked with the rest of this days deeds or by the Lord I
will have it in a particular ballad else with mine own picture on the
top ont Colevile kissing my foot to the which course if I be
enforced if you do not all show like gilt twopences to me and I in
the clear sky of fame oershine you as much as the full moon doth the
cinders of the element which show like pins heads to her believe not
the word of the noble Therefore let me have right and let desert
mount

LANCASTER
Thines too heavy to mount

FALSTAFF
Let it shine then

LANCASTER
Thines too thick to shine

FALSTAFF
Let it do something my good lord that may do me good and call it
what you will

LANCASTER
Is thy name Colevile

COLEVILE
It is my lord

LANCASTER
A famous rebel art thou Colevile

FALSTAFF
And a famous true subject took him

COLEVILE
I am my lord but as my betters are
That led me hither Had they been ruled by me
You should have won them dearer than you have

FALSTAFF
I know not how they sold themselves but thou like a kind fellow
gavest thyself away gratis and I thank thee for thee

Enter Westmoreland

LANCASTER
Now have you left pursuit

WESTMORELAND
Retreat is made and execution stayd

LANCASTER
Send Colevile with his confederates
To York to present execution

Exeunt Blunt and others with Colevile

And now dispatch we toward the court my lords
I hear the King my father is sore sick
Our news shall go before us to his Majesty
Which cousin you shall bear to comfort him
And we with sober speed will follow you

FALSTAFF
My lord I beseech you give me leave to go through Gloucestershire
and when you come to court stand my good lord pray in your good
report

LANCASTER
Fare you well Falstaff I in my condition
Shall better speak of you than you deserve

Exeunt all but Falstaff

FALSTAFF
I would you had but the wit twere better than your dukedom Good
faith this same young soberblooded boy doth not love me nor a man
cannot make him laugh but thats no marvel he drinks no wine Theres
never none of these demure boys come to any proof for thin drink doth
so overcool their blood and making many fish meals that they fall
into a kind of male greensickness and then when they marry they get
wenches They are generally fools and cowards which some of us should
be too but for inflammation A good sherrissack hath a twofold
operation in it It ascends me into the brain dries me there all the
foolish and dull and crudy vapours which environ it makes it
apprehensive quick forgetive full of nimble fiery and delectable
shapes which delivered oer to the voice the tongue which is the
birth becomes excellent wit The second property of your excellent
sherris is the warming of the blood which before cold and settled
left the liver white and pale which is the badge of pusillanimity and
cowardice But the sherris warms it and makes it course from the
inwards to the parts extremes It illumineth the face which as a
beacon gives warning to all the rest of this little kingdom man to
arm and then the vital commoners and inland petty spirits muster me
all to their captain the heart who great and puffed up with this
retinue doth any deed of courage and this valour comes of sherris So
that skill in the weapon is nothing without sack for that sets it
awork and learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil till sack
commences it and sets it in act and use Hereof comes it that Prince
Harry is valiant for the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his
father he hath like lean sterile and bare land manured husbanded
and tilled with excellent endeavour of drinking good and good store of
fertile sherris that he is become very hot and valiant If I had a
thousand sons the first humane principle I would teach them should be
to forswear thin potations and to addict themselves to sack

Enter Bardolph

How now Bardolph

BARDOLPH
The army is discharged all and gone

FALSTAFF
Let them go Ill through Gloucestershire and there will I visit
Master Robert Shallow Esquire I have him already tempering between my
finger and my thumb and shortly will I seal with him Come away

Exeunt

SCENE IV Westminster The Jerusalem Chamber

Gloucester and others

Now lords if God doth give successful end
To this debate that bleedeth at our doors
We will our youth lead on to higher fields
And draw no swords but what are sanctified
Our navy is addressd our power collected
Our substitutes in absence well invested
And everything lies level to our wish
Only we want a little personal strength
And pause us till these rebels now afoot
Come underneath the yoke of government

I do not know my lord

KING
Is not his brother Thomas of Clarence with him

GLOUCESTER
No my good lord he is in presence here

CLARENCE
What would my lord and father

KING
Nothing but well to thee Thomas of Clarence
How chance thou art not with the Prince thy brother
He loves thee and thou dost neglect him Thomas
Thou hast a better place in his affection
Than all thy brothers Cherish it my boy
And noble offices thou mayst effect
Of mediation after I am dead
Between his greatness and thy other brethren
Therefore omit him not blunt not his love
Nor lose the good advantage of his grace
By seeming cold or careless of his will
For he is gracious if he be observed
He hath a tear for pity and a hand
Open as day for melting charity
Yet notwithstanding being incensed hes flint
As humorous as winter and as sudden
As flaws congealed in the spring of day
His temper therefore must be well observed
Chide him for faults and do it reverently
When you perceive his blood inclined to mirth
But being moody give him time and scope
Till that his passions like a whale on ground
Confound themselves with working Learn this Thomas
And thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends
A hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in
That the united vessel of their blood
Mingled with venom of suggestion
As force perforce the age will pour it in
Shall never leak though it do work as strong
As aconitum or rash gunpowder

CLARENCE
I shall observe him with all care and love

KING
Why art thou not at Windsor with him Thomas

CLARENCE
He is not there today he dines in London

KING
And how accompanied Canst thou tell that

CLARENCE
With Poins and other his continual followers

KING
Most subject is the fattest soil to weeds
And he the noble image of my youth
Is overspread with them therefore my grief
Stretches itself beyond the hour of death
The blood weeps from my heart when I do shape
In forms imaginary th unguided days
And rotten times that you shall look upon
When I am sleeping with my ancestors
For when his headstrong riot hath no curb
When rage and hot blood are his counsellors
When means and lavish manners meet together
O with what wings shall his affections fly
Towards fronting peril and opposed decay

WARWICK
My gracious lord you look beyond him quite
The prince but studies his companions
Like a strange tongue wherein to gain the language
Tis needful that the most immodest word
Be looked upon and learned which once attained
Your Highness knows comes to no further use
But to be known and hated So like gross terms
The Prince will in the perfectness of time
Cast off his followers and their memory
Shall as a pattern or a measure live
By which his Grace must mete the lives of other
Turning past evils to advantages

KING
Tis seldom when the bee doth leave her comb
In the dead carrion

Enter Westmoreland

Whos here Westmoreland

WESTMORELAND
Health to my sovereign and new happiness
Added to that that I am to deliver
Prince John your son doth kiss your Graces hand
Mowbray the Bishop Scroop Hastings and all
Are brought to the correction of your law
There is not now a rebels sword unsheathed
But Peace puts forth her olive everywhere
The manner how this action hath been borne
Here at more leisure may your Highness read
With every course in his particular

KING
O Westmoreland thou art a summer bird
Which ever in the haunch of winter sings
The lifting up of day

Enter Harcourt

Look heres more news

HARCOURT
From enemies heaven keep your Majesty
And when they stand against you may they fall
As those that I am come to tell you of
The Earl Northumberland and the Lord Bardolph
With a great power of English and of Scots
Are by the shrieve of Yorkshire overthrown
The manner and true order of the fight
This packet please it you contains at large

KING
And wherefore should these good news make me sick
Will Fortune never come with both hands full
But write her fair words still in foulest letters
She either gives a stomach and no food
Such are the poor in health or else a feast
And takes away the stomachsuch are the rich
That have abundance and enjoy it not
I should rejoice now at this happy news
And now my sight fails and my brain is giddy
O me Come near me now I am much ill

GLOUCESTER
Comfort your Majesty

CLARENCE
O my royal father

WESTMORELAND
My sovereign lord cheer up yourself look up

WARWICK
Be patient princes you do know these fits
Are with his Highness very ordinary
Stand from him give him air hell straight be well

CLARENCE
No no he cannot long hold out these pangs
Th incessant care and labour of his mind
Hath wrought the mure that should confine it in
So thin that life looks through and will break out

GLOUCESTER
The people fear me for they do observe
Unfatherd heirs and loathly births of nature
The seasons change their manners as the year
Had found some months asleep and leapd them over

CLARENCE
The river hath thrice flowd no ebb between
And the old folk times doting chronicles
Say it did so a little time before
That our greatgrandsire Edward sickd and died

WARWICK
Speak lower princes for the King recovers

GLOUCESTER
This apoplexy will certain be his end

KING
I pray you take me up and bear me hence
Into some other chamber softly pray

Exeunt

SCENE V Another chamber

The King lying on a bed Clarence Gloucester Warwick and others in
attendance

KING
Let there be no noise made my gentle friends
Unless some dull and favourable hand
Will whisper music to my weary spirit

WARWICK
Call for the music in the other room

KING
Set me the crown upon my pillow here

CLARENCE
His eye is hollow and he changes much

WARWICK
Less noise less noise

Enter Prince Henry

WARWICK
Not so much noise my lords Sweet prince speak low
The King your father is disposed to sleep

CLARENCE
Let us withdraw into the other room

WARWICK
Willt please your Grace to go along with us

PRINCE
No I will sit and watch here by the King

Exeunt all but the Prince

Why doth the crown lie there upon his pillow
Being so troublesome a bedfellow
O polishd perturbation golden care
That keepst the ports of slumber open wide
To many a watchful night Sleep with it now
Yet not so sound and half so deeply sweet
As he whose brow with homely biggen bound
Snores out the watch of night O majesty
When thou dost pinch thy bearer thou dost sit
Like a rich armour worn in heat of day
That scaldst with safety By his gates of breath
There lies a downy feather which stirs not
Did he suspire that light and weightless down
Perforce must move My gracious lord my father
This sleep is sound indeed this is a sleep
That from this golden rigol hath divorced
So many English kings Thy due from me
Is tears and heavy sorrows of the blood
Which nature love and filial tenderness
Shall O dear father pay thee plenteously
My due from thee is this imperial crown
Which as immediate from thy place and blood
Derives itself to me Lo where it sits
Which God shall guard and put the worlds whole strength
Into one giant arm it shall not force
This lineal honour from me This from thee
Will I to mine leave as tis left to me

CLARENCE
Doth the King call

WARWICK
What would your Majesty How fares your Grace

KING
Why did you leave me here alone my lords

CLARENCE
We left the Prince my brother here my liege
Who undertook to sit and watch by you

KING
The Prince of Wales Where is he Let me see him
He is not here

WARWICK
This door is open he is gone this way

GLOUCESTER
He came not through the chamber where we stayd

KING
Where is the crown Who took it from my pillow

WARWICK
When we withdrew my liege we left it here

KING
The Prince hath taen it hence Go seek him out
Is he so hasty that he doth suppose
My sleep my death
Find him my Lord of Warwick chide him hither

Exit Warwick

This part of his conjoins with my disease
And helps to end me See sons what things you are
How quickly nature falls into revolt
When gold becomes her object
For this the foolish overcareful fathers
Have broke their sleep with thoughts
Their brains with care their bones with industry
For this they have engrossed and piled up
The cankerd heaps of strangeachieved gold
For this they have been thoughtful to invest
Their sons with arts and martial exercises
When like the bee tolling from every flower
The virtuous sweets
Our thighs packd with wax our mouths with honey
We bring it to the hive and like the bees
Are murdered for our pains This bitter taste
Yields his engrossments to the ending father

Enter Warwick

Now where is he that will not stay so long
Till his friend sickness hath determind me

WARWICK
My lord I found the Prince in the next room
Washing with kindly tears his gentle cheeks
With such a deep demeanour in great sorrow
That tyranny which never quaffd but blood
Would by beholding him have washd his knife
With gentle eyedrops He is coming hither

KING
But wherefore did he take away the crown

Enter Prince Henry

Lo where he comes Come hither to me Harry
Depart the chamber leave us here alone

Exeunt Warwick and the rest

PRINCE
I never thought to hear you speak again

KING
Thy wish was father Harry to that thought
I stay too long by thee I weary thee
Dost thou so hunger for mine empty chair
That thou wilt needs invest thee with my honours
Before thy hour be ripe O foolish youth
Thou seekst the greatness that will overwhelm thee
Stay but a little for my cloud of dignity
Is held from falling with so weak a wind
That it will quickly drop My day is dim
Thou hast stolen that which after some few hours
Were thine without offence and at my death
Thou hast seald up my expectation
Thy life did manifest thou lovedst me not
And thou wilt have me die assured of it
Thou hidst a thousand daggers in thy thoughts
Which thou hast whetted on thy stony heart
To stab at half an hour of my life
What canst thou not forbear me half an hour
Then get thee gone and dig my grave thyself
And bid the merry bells ring to thine ear
That thou art crowned not that I am dead
Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse
Be drops of balm to sanctify thy head
Only compound me with forgotten dust
Give that which gave thee life unto the worms
Pluck down my officers break my decrees
For now a time is come to mock at form
Harry the Fifth is crownd Up vanity
Down royal state All you sage counsellors hence
And to the English court assemble now
From every region apes of idleness
Now neighbour confines purge you of your scum
Have you a ruffian that will swear drink dance
Revel the night rob murder and commit
The oldest sins the newest kind of ways
Be happy he will trouble you no more
England shall double gild his treble guilt
England shall give him office honour might
For the fifth Harry from curbd license plucks
The muzzle of restraint and the wild dog
Shall flesh his tooth on every innocent
O my poor kingdom sick with civil blows
When that my care could not withhold thy riots
What wilt thou do when riot is thy care
O thou wilt be a wilderness again
Peopled with wolves thy old inhabitants

PRINCE
O pardon me my liege But for my tears
The moist impediments unto my speech
I had forestalld this dear and deep rebuke
Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
The course of it so far There is your crown
And He that wears the crown immortally
Long guard it yours If I affect it more
Than as your honour and as your renown
Let me no more from this obedience rise
Which my most inward true and duteous spirit
Teacheth this prostrate and exterior bending
God witness with me when I here came in
And found no course of breath within your Majesty
How cold it struck my heart If I do feign
O let me in my present wildness die
And never live to show th incredulous world
The noble change that I have purposed
Coming to look on you thinking you dead
And dead almost my liege to think you were
I spake unto this crown as having sense
And thus upbraided it The care on thee depending
Hath fed upon the body of my father
Therefore thou best of gold art worst of gold
Other less fine in carat is more precious
Preserving life in medcine potable
But thou most fine most honourd most renownd
Hast eat thy bearer up Thus my most royal liege
Accusing it I put it on my head
To try with it as with an enemy
That had before my face murderd my father
The quarrel of a true inheritor
But if it did infect my blood with joy
Or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride
If any rebel or vain spirit of mine
Did with the least affection of a welcome
Give entertainment to the might of it
Let God for ever keep it from my head
And make me as the poorest vassal is
That doth with awe and terror kneel to it

KING
O my son
God put it in thy mind to take it hence
That thou mightst win the more thy fathers love
Pleading so wisely in excuse of it
Come hither Harry sit thou by my bed
And hear I think the very latest counsel
That ever I shall breathe God knows my son
By what bypaths and indirect crookd ways
I met this crown and I myself know well
How troublesome it sat upon my head
To thee it shall descend with better quiet
Better opinion better confirmation
For all the soil of the achievement goes
With me into the earth It seemd in me
But as an honour snatchd with boisterous hand
And I had many living to upbraid
My gain of it by their assistances
Which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed
Wounding supposed peace All these bold fears
Thou seest with peril I have answered
For all my reign hath been but as a scene
Acting that argument And now my death
Changes the mood for what in me was purchased
Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort
So thou the garland wearst successively
Yet though thou standst more sure than I could do
Thou art not firm enough since griefs are green
And all my friends which thou must make thy friends
Have but their stings and teeth newly taen out
By whose fell working I was first advanced
And by whose power I well might lodge a fear
To be again displaced which to avoid
I cut them off and had a purpose now
To lead out many to the Holy Land
Lest rest and lying still might make them look
Too near unto my state Therefore my Harry
Be it thy course to busy giddy minds
With foreign quarrels that action hence borne out
May waste the memory of the former days
More would I but my lungs are wasted so
That strength of speech is utterly denied me
How I came by the crown O God forgive
And grant it may with thee in true peace live

PRINCE
My gracious liege
You won it wore it kept it gave it me
Then plain and right must my possession be
Which I with more than with a common pain
Gainst all the world will rightfully maintain

Enter Lord John of Lancaster and others

KING
Look look here comes my John of Lancaster

LANCASTER
Health peace and happiness to my royal father

From this bare witherd trunk Upon thy sight
My worldly business makes a period
Where is my Lord of Warwick

PRINCE
My Lord of Warwick

Enter Warwick and others

KING
Doth any name particular belong
Unto the lodging where I first did swoon

WARWICK
Tis calld Jerusalem my noble lord

KING
Laud be to God Even there my life must end
It hath been prophesied to me many years
I should not die but in Jerusalem
Which vainly I supposed the Holy Land
But bear me to that chamber there Ill lie
In that Jerusalem shall Harry die

SHALLOW
I will not excuse you you shall not be excused Excuses shall not be
admitted there is no excuse shall serve you shall not be excused

Enter Davy

DAVY

SHALLOW

Yea marry William cook bid him come hither Sir John you shall not
be excused

DAVY
Marry sir thus those precepts cannot be served and again sirshall
we sow the hade land with wheat

SHALLOW
With red wheat Davy But for William cook are there no young pigeons

DAVY
Yes sir Here is now the smiths note for shoeing and ploughirons

SHALLOW
Let it be cast and paid Sir John you shall not be excused

DAVY
Now sir a new link to the bucket must needs be had And sir do you
mean to stop any of Williams wages about the sack he lost the other
day at Hinckley fair

SHALLOW
He shall answer it Some pigeons Davy a couple of shortlegged hens
a joint of mutton and any pretty little tiny kickshaws tell William
cook

DAVY
Doth the man of war stay all night sir

SHALLOW
Yea Davy I will use him well a friend i th court is better than a
penny in purse Use his men well Davy for they are arrant knaves and
will backbite

DAVY
No worse than they are backbitten sir for they have marvellous foul
linen

SHALLOW
Well conceited Davy About thy business Davy

DAVY
I beseech you sir to countenance William Visor of Woncot against
Clement Perkes o th hill

SHALLOW
There is many complaints Davy against that Visor That Visor is an
arrant knave on my knowledge

DAVY
I grant your worship that he is a knave sir but yet God forbid sir
but a knave should have some countenance at his friends request An
honest man sir is able to speak for himself when a knave is not I
have served your worship truly sir this eight years and if I cannot
once or twice in a quarter bear out a knave against an honest man I
have but a very little credit with your worship The knave is mine
honest friend sir therefore I beseech your worship let him be
countenanced

SHALLOW
Go to I say he shall have no wrong Look about Davy

Exit Davy

Where are you Sir John Come come come off with your boots
Give me your hand Master Bardolph

BARDOLPH

tall fellow to the Page Come Sir John

FALSTAFF
Ill follow you good Master Robert Shallow

Exit Shallow

Bardolph look to our horses

Exeunt Bardolph and Page

If I were sawed into quantities I should make four dozen of such
bearded hermits staves as Master Shallow It is a wonderful thing to
see the semblable coherence of his mens spirits and his They by
observing of him do bear themselves like foolish justices he by
conversing with them is turned into a justicelike servingman Their
spirits are so married in conjunction with the participation of society
that they flock together in consent like so many wildgeese If I had
a suit to Master Shallow I would humour his men with the imputation of
being near their master if to his men I would curry with Master
Shallow that no man could better command his servants It is certain
that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is caught as men take
diseases one of another Therefore let men take heed of their company
I will devise matter enough out of this Shallow to keep Prince Harry in
continual laughter the wearing out of six fashions which is four
terms or two actions and he shall laugh without intervallums O it
is much that a lie with a slight oath and a jest with a sad brow will
do with a fellow that never had the ache in his shoulders O you shall
see him laugh till his face be like a wet cloak ill laid up

SHALLOW
Within Sir John

Exceeding well His cares are now all ended

CHIEF JUSTICE
I hope not dead

WARWICK
Hes walkd the way of nature
And to our purposes he lives no more

CHIEF JUSTICE
I would his Majesty had calld me with him
The service that I truly did his life
Hath left me open to all injuries

WARWICK
Indeed I think the young King loves you not

CHIEF JUSTICE
I know he doth not and do arm myself
To welcome the condition of the time
Which cannot look more hideously upon me
Than I have drawn it in my fantasy

Enter Lancaster Clarence Gloucester and others

WARWICK
Here comes the heavy issue of dead Harry
O that the living Harry had the temper
Of he the worst of these three gentlemen
How many nobles then should hold their places
That must strike sail to spirits of vile sort

CHIEF JUSTICE
O God I fear all will be overturnd

LANCASTER
Good morrow cousin Warwick good morrow

GLOUCESTER  CLARENCE
Good morrow cousin

LANCASTER
We meet like men that had forgot to speak

WARWICK
We do remember but our argument
Is all too heavy to admit much talk

LANCASTER
Well peace be with him that hath made us heavy

CHIEF JUSTICE
Peace be with us lest we be heavier

GLOUCESTER
O good my lord you have lost a friend indeed
And I dare swear you borrow not that face
Of seeming sorrow it is sure your own

LANCASTER
Though no man be assured what grace to find
You stand in coldest expectation
I am the sorrier would twere otherwise

CLARENCE
Well you must now speak Sir John Falstaff fair
Which swims against your stream of quality

CHIEF JUSTICE
Sweet Princes what I did I did in honour
Led by th impartial conduct of my soul
And never shall you see that I will beg
A ragged and forestalld remission
If truth and upright innocency fail me
Ill to the King my master that is dead
And tell him who hath sent me after him

WARWICK
Here comes the Prince

Enter King Henry the Fifth attended

CHIEF JUSTICE
Good morrow and God save your Majesty

KING
This new and gorgeous garment majesty
Sits not so easy on me as you think
Brothers you mix your sadness with some fear
This is the English not the Turkish court
Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds
But Harry Harry Yet be sad good brothers
For by my faith it very well becomes you
Sorrow so royally in you appears
That I will deeply put the fashion on
And wear it in my heart Why then be sad
But entertain no more of it good brothers
Than a joint burden laid upon us all
For me by heaven I bid you be assured
Ill be your father and your brother too
Let me but bear your love Ill bear your cares
Yet weep that Harrys dead and so will I
But Harry lives that shall convert those tears
By number into hours of happiness

PRINCES
We hope no otherwise from your Majesty

KING
You all look strangely on me And you most
You are I think assured I love you not

CHIEF JUSTICE
I am assured if I be measured rightly
Your Majesty hath no just cause to hate me

KING
No
How might a prince of my great hopes forget
So great indignities you laid upon me
What rate rebuke and roughly send to prison
Th immediate heir of England Was this easy
May this be washd in Lethe and forgotten

CHIEF JUSTICE
I then did use the person of your father
The image of his power lay then in me
And in the administration of his law
Whiles I was busy for the commonwealth
Your Highness pleased to forget my place
The majesty and power of law and justice
The image of the King whom I presented
And struck me in my very seat of judgement
Whereon as an offender to your father
I gave bold way to my authority
And did commit you If the deed were ill
Be you contented wearing now the garland
To have a son set your decrees at nought
To pluck down justice from your awful bench
To trip the course of law and blunt the sword
That guards the peace and safety of your person
Nay more to spurn at your most royal image
And mock your workings in a second body
Question your royal thoughts make the case yours
Be now the father and propose a son
Hear your own dignity so much profaned
See your most dreadful laws so loosely slighted
Behold yourself so by a son disdaind
And then imagine me taking your part
And in your power soft silencing your son
After this cold considerance sentence me
And as you are a king speak in your state
What I have done that misbecame my place
My person or my lieges sovereignty

KING
You are right justice and you weigh this well
Therefore still bear the balance and the sword
And I do wish your honours may increase
Till you do live to see a son of mine
Offend you and obey you as I did
So shall I live to speak my fathers words
Happy am I that have a man so bold
That dares do justice on my proper son
And not less happy having such a son
That would deliver up his greatness so
Into the hands of justice You did commit me
For which I do commit into your hand
Th unstained sword that you have used to bear
With this remembrance that you use the same
With the like bold just and impartial spirit
As you have done gainst me There is my hand
You shall be as a father to my youth
My voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear
And I will stoop and humble my intents
To your wellpractised wise directions
And princes all believe me I beseech you
My father is gone wild into his grave
For in his tomb lie my affections
And with his spirit sadly I survive
To mock the expectation of the world
To frustrate prophecies and to raze out
Rotten opinion who hath writ me down
After my seeming The tide of blood in me
Hath proudly flowd in vanity till now
Now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea
Where it shall mingle with the state of floods
And flow henceforth in formal majesty
Now call we our high court of parliament
And let us choose such limbs of noble counsel
That the great body of our state may go
In equal rank with the bestgovernd nation
That war or peace or both at once may be
As things acquainted and familiar to us
In which you father shall have foremost hand
Our coronation done we will accite
As I before rememberd all our state
And God consigning to my good intents
No prince nor peer shall have just cause to say
God shorten Harrys happy life one day

KING
I know thee not old man Fall to thy prayers
How ill white hairs becomes a fool and jester
I have long dreamt of such a kind of man
So surfeitswelld so old and so profane
But being awaked I do despise my dream
Make less thy body hence and more thy grace
Leave gormandizing know the grave doth gape
For thee thrice wider than for other men
Reply not to me with a foolborn jest
Presume not that I am the thing I was
For God doth know so shall the world perceive
That I have turnd away my former self
So will I those that kept me company
When thou dost hear I am as I have been
Approach me and thou shalt be as thou wast
The tutor and the feeder of my riots
Till then I banish thee on pain of death
As I have done the rest of my misleaders
Not to come near our person by ten mile
For competence of life I will allow you
That lack of means enforce you not to evils
And as we hear you do reform yourselves
We will according to your strengths and qualities
Give you advancement Be it your charge my lord
To see performd the tenor of our word
Set on

Whose music to my thinking pleased the King

EPILOGUE


First my fear then my curtsy last my speech My fear is your
displeasure my curtsy my duty and my speech to beg your pardons If
you look for a good speech now you undo me for what I have to say is
of mine own making and what indeed I should say will I doubt prove
mine own marring But to the purpose and so to the venture Be it
known to you as it is very well I was lately here in the end of a
displeasing play to pray your patience for it and to promise you a
better I meant indeed to pay you with this which if like an ill
venture it come unluckily home I break and you my gentle creditors
lose Here I promised you I would be and here I commit my body to your
mercies Bate me some and I will pay you some and as most debtors
do promise you infinitely

If my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me will you command me to
use my legs And yet that were but light payment to dance out of your
debt But a good conscience will make any possible satisfaction and so
would I All the gentlewomen here have forgiven me if the gentlemen
will not then the gentlemen do not agree with the gentlewomen which
was never seen before in such an assembly

One word more I beseech you If you be not too much cloyed with fat
meat our humble author will continue the story with Sir John in it
and make you merry with fair Katharine of France where for anything I
know Falstaff shall die of a sweat unless already he be killed with
your hard opinions for Oldcastle died a martyr and this is not the
man My tongue is weary when my legs are too I will bid you good
night
