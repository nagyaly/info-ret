for his precisian he admits him not for his counsellor You are not
young no more am I Go to then theres sympathy You are merry so
am I Ha ha then theres more sympathy You love sack and so do I
Would you desire better sympathy Let it suffice thee Mistress Page

By me
Thine own true knight
By day or night
Or any kind of light
With all his might
For thee to fight
John Falstaff
What a Herod of Jewry is this O wicked wicked world One that is
wellnigh worn to pieces with age to show himself a young gallant
What an unweighed behaviour hath this Flemish drunkard pickedwith the
devils nameout of my conversation that he dares in this manner
assay me Why he hath not been thrice in my company What should I say
to him I was then frugal of my mirth Heaven forgive me Why Ill
exhibit a bill in the parliament for the putting down of men How shall
I be revenged on him For revenged I will be as sure as his guts are
made of puddings

Enter Mistress Ford

MISTRESS FORD
Mistress Page Trust me I was going to your house

Mistress Page give me some counsel

honour

MISTRESS PAGE
Hang the trifle woman take the honour What is it Dispense with
trifles What is it

MISTRESS FORD
If I would but go to hell for an eternal moment or so I could be
knighted

MISTRESS PAGE
What Thou liest Sir Alice Ford These knights will hack and so thou
shouldst not alter the article of thy gentry

MISTRESS FORD
We burn daylight Here read read Perceive how I might be knighted I
shall think the worse of fat men as long as I have an eye to make
difference of mens liking And yet he would not swear praised womens
modesty and gave such orderly and wellbehaved reproof to all
uncomeliness that I would have sworn his disposition would have gone to
the truth of his words But they do no more adhere and keep place
together than the Hundredth Psalm to the tune of Greensleeves What
tempest I trow threw this whale with so many tuns of oil in his
belly ashore at Windsor How shall I be revenged on him I think the
best way were to entertain him with hope till the wicked fire of lust
have melted him in his own grease Did you ever hear the like

MISTRESS PAGE
Letter for letter but that the name of Page and Ford differs To thy
great comfort in this mystery of ill opinions heres the twin brother
of thy letter But let thine inherit first for I protest mine never
shall I warrant he hath a thousand of these letters writ with blank
space for different namessure more and these are of the second
edition He will print them out of doubt for he cares not what he
puts into the press when he would put us two I had rather be a
giantess and lie under Mount Pelion Well I will find you twenty
lascivious turtles ere one chaste man

MISTRESS FORD
Why this is the very samethe very hand the very words What doth he
think of us

MISTRESS PAGE
Nay I know not It makes me almost ready to wrangle with mine own
honesty Ill entertain myself like one that I am not acquainted
withal for sure unless he know some strain in me that I know not
myself he would never have boarded me in this fury

MISTRESS FORD
Boarding call you it Ill be sure to keep him above deck

MISTRESS PAGE
So will I If he come under my hatches Ill never to sea again Lets
be revenged on him Lets appoint him a meeting give him a show of
comfort in his suit and lead him on with a finebaited delay till he
hath pawned his horses to mine host of the Garter

MISTRESS FORD
Nay I will consent to act any villainy against him that may not sully
the chariness of our honesty O that my husband saw this letter It
would give eternal food to his jealousy

MISTRESS PAGE
Why look where he comes and my good man too Hes as far from
jealousy as I am from giving him cause and that I hope is an
unmeasurable distance

discarded men very rogues now they be out of service

words let it lie on my head

A man may be too confident I would have nothing lie on my head I

warrant you in silk and gold and in such alligant terms and in such
wine and sugar of the best and the fairest that would have won any
womans heart and I warrant you they could never get an eyewink of
her I had myself twenty angels given me this morning but I defy all
angels in any such sort as they say but in the way of honesty And I
warrant you they could never get her so much as sip on a cup with the
proudest of them all And yet there has been earlsnay which is more

FORD
Sir I am a gentleman that have spent much My name is Brook

FALSTAFF
Good Master Brook I desire more acquaintance of you

FORD
Good Sir John I sue for yours not to charge you for I must let you
understand I think myself in better plight for a lender than you are
the which hath something emboldened me to this unseasoned intrusion
for they say if money go before all ways do lie open

FALSTAFF
Money is a good soldier sir and will on

FORD
Troth and I have a bag of money here troubles me If you will help to
bear it Sir John take all or half for easing me of the carriage

FALSTAFF
Sir I know not how I may deserve to be your porter

FORD
I will tell you sir if you will give me the hearing

FALSTAFF
Speak good Master Brook I shall be glad to be your servant

FORD
Sir I hear you are a scholarI will be brief with youand you have
been a man long known to me though I had never so good means as desire
to make myself acquainted with you I shall discover a thing to you
wherein I must very much lay open mine own imperfection But good Sir
John as you have one eye upon my follies as you hear them unfolded
turn another into the register of your own that I may pass with a
reproof the easier sith you yourself know how easy it is to be such an
offender

FALSTAFF
Very well sir proceed

FORD
There is a gentlewoman in this town her husbands name is Ford

FALSTAFF
Well sir

FORD
I have long loved her and I protest to you bestowed much on her
followed her with a doting observance engrossed opportunities to meet
her feed every slight occasion that could but niggardly give me sight
of her not only bought many presents to give her but have given
largely to many to know what she would have given Briefly I have
pursued her as love hath pursued me which hath been on the wing of all
occasions But whatsoever I have merited either in my mind or in my
means meed I am sure I have received none unless experience be a
jewel That I have purchased at an infinite rate and that hath taught
me to say this
Love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues
Pursuing that that flies and flying what pursues

FALSTAFF
Have you received no promise of satisfaction at her hands

FORD
Never

FALSTAFF
Have you importuned her to such a purpose

FORD
Never

FALSTAFF
Of what quality was your love then

FORD
Like a fair house built on another mans ground so that I have lost my
edifice by mistaking the place where I erected it

FALSTAFF
To what purpose have you unfolded this to me

FORD
When I have told you that I have told you all Some say that though
she appear honest to me yet in other places she enlargeth her mirth so
far that there is shrewd construction made of her Now Sir John here
is the heart of my purpose you are a gentleman of excellent breeding
admirable discourse of great admittance authentic in your place and
person generally allowed for your many warlike courtlike and learned
preparations

FALSTAFF
O sir

FORD
Believe it for you know it There is money Spend it spend it spend
more spend all I have only give me so much of your time in exchange
of it as to lay an amiable siege to the honesty of this Fords wife
Use your art of wooing win her to consent to you If any man may you
may as soon as any

FALSTAFF
Would it apply well to the vehemency of your affection that I should
win what you would enjoy Methinks you prescribe to yourself very
preposterously

FORD
O understand my drift She dwells so securely on the excellency of her
honour that the folly of my soul dares not present itself she is too
bright to be looked against Now could I come to her with any
detection in my hand my desires had instance and argument to commend
themselves I could drive her then from the ward of her purity her
reputation her marriage vow and a thousand other her defences which
now are too too strongly embattled against me What say you tot Sir
John

FALSTAFF
Master Brook I will first make bold with your money next give me
your hand and last as I am a gentleman you shall if you will enjoy
Fords wife

FORD
O good sir

FALSTAFF
I say you shall

FORD
Want no money Sir John you shall want none

FALSTAFF
Want no Mistress Ford Master Brook you shall want none I shall be
with her I may tell you by her own appointment even as you came in
to me her assistant or gobetween parted from me I say I shall be
with her between ten and eleven for at that time the jealous rascally
knave her husband will be forth Come you to me at night You shall
know how I speed

FORD
I am blessed in your acquaintance Do you know Ford sir

FALSTAFF
Hang him poor cuckoldly knave I know him not Yet I wrong him to call
him poor They say the jealous wittolly knave hath masses of money for
the which his wife seems to me wellfavoured I will use her as the key
of the cuckoldly rogues coffer and theres my harvesthome

FORD
I would you knew Ford sir that you might avoid him if you saw him

FALSTAFF
Hang him mechanical saltbutter rogue I will stare him out of his
wits I will awe him with my cudgel it shall hang like a meteor oer
the cuckolds horns Master Brook thou shalt know I will predominate
over the peasant and thou shalt lie with his wife Come to me soon at
night Fords a knave and I will aggravate his style Thou Master
Brook shalt know him for knave and cuckold Come to me soon at night

Exit Falstaff

FORD
What a damned epicurean rascal is this My heart is ready to crack with
impatience Who says this is improvident jealousy My wife hath sent to
him the hour is fixed the match is made Would any man have thought
this See the hell of having a false woman my bed shall be abused my
coffers ransacked my reputation gnawn at and I shall not only receive
this villanous wrong but stand under the adoption of abominable terms
and by him that does me this wrong Terms names Amaimon sounds well
Lucifer well Barbason well yet they are devils additions the
names of fiends But cuckold Wittol Cuckold The devil himself hath
not such a name Page is an ass a secure ass he will trust his wife
he will not be jealous I will rather trust a Fleming with my butter
Parson Hugh the Welshman with my cheese an Irishman with my aquavitae
bottle or a thief to walk my ambling gelding than my wife with
herself Then she plots then she ruminates then she devises and what
they think in their hearts they may effect they will break their
hearts but they will effect God be praised for my jealousy Eleven
oclock the hour I will prevent this detect my wife be revenged on
Falstaff and laugh at Page I will about it Better three hours too
soon than a minute too late Fie fie fie Cuckold cuckold cuckold

water will do him a benefit

here for I never saw him so gross in his jealousy till now

Falstaff His dissolute disease will scarce obey this medicine

his throwing into the water and give him another hope to betray him

FALSTAFF
Master Brook I will not lie to you I was at her house the hour she
appointed me

FORD
And how sped you sir

FALSTAFF
Very illfavouredly Master Brook

FORD
How so sir Did she change her determination

FALSTAFF
No Master Brook but the peaking cornuto her husband Master Brook
dwelling in a continual larum of jealousy comes me in the instant of
our encounter after we had embraced kissed protested and as it
were spoke the prologue of our comedy and at his heels a rabble of
his companions thither provoked and instigated by his distemper and
forsooth to search his house for his wifes love

FORD
What while you were there

FALSTAFF
While I was there

FORD
And did he search for you and could not find you

FALSTAFF
You shall hear As good luck would have it comes in one Mistress Page
gives intelligence of Fords approach and in her invention and Fords
wifes distraction they conveyed me into a buckbasket

FORD
A buckbasket

FALSTAFF
By the Lord a buckbasket Rammed me in with foul shirts and smocks
socks foul stockings greasy napkins that Master Brook there was
the rankest compound of villainous smell that ever offended nostril

FORD
And how long lay you there

FALSTAFF
Nay you shall hear Master Brook what I have suffered to bring this
woman to evil for your good Being thus crammed in the basket a couple
of Fords knaves his hinds were called forth by their mistress to
carry me in the name of foul clothes to Datchet Lane They took me on
their shoulders met the jealous knave their master in the door who
asked them once or twice what they had in their basket I quaked for
fear lest the lunatic knave would have searched it but Fate ordaining
he should be a cuckold held his hand Well on went he for a search
and away went I for foul clothes But mark the sequel Master Brook I
suffered the pangs of three several deaths first an intolerable
fright to be detected with a jealous rotten bellwether next to be
compassed like a good bilbo in the circumference of a peck hilt to
point heel to head and then to be stopped in like a strong
distillation with stinking clothes that fretted in their own grease
Think of that a man of my kidney think of thatthat am as subject to
heat as butter a man of continual dissolution and thaw It was a
miracle to scape suffocation And in the height of this bath when I
was more than half stewed in grease like a Dutch dish to be thrown
into the Thames and cooled glowing hot in that surge like a
horseshoe Think of thathissing hotthink of that Master Brook

FORD
In good sadness sir I am sorry that for my sake you have suffered all
this My suit then is desperate Youll undertake her no more

FALSTAFF
Master Brook I will be thrown into Etna as I have been into Thames
ere I will leave her thus Her husband is this morning gone abirding
I have received from her another embassy of meeting Twixt eight and
nine is the hour Master Brook

FORD
Tis past eight already sir

FALSTAFF
Is it I will then address me to my appointment Come to me at your
convenient leisure and you shall know how I speed and the conclusion
shall be crowned with your enjoying her Adieu You shall have her
Master Brook Master Brook you shall cuckold Ford

Exit Falstaff

FORD
Hum Ha Is this a vision Is this a dream Do I sleep Master Ford
awake awake Master Ford Theres a hole made in your best coat
Master Ford This tis to be married this tis to have linen and
buckbaskets Well I will proclaim myself what I am I will now take
the lecher He is at my house He cannot scape me Tis impossible he
should He cannot creep into a halfpenny purse nor into a pepperbox
But lest the devil that guides him should aid him I will search
impossible places Though what I am I cannot avoid yet to be what I
would not shall not make me tame If I have horns to make one mad let
the proverb go with me Ill be hornmad

in the way of waste attempt us again

MISTRESS FORD
Shall we tell our husbands how we have served him

Enter Page Ford Mistress Page Mistress Ford and Sir Hugh Evans

EVANS
Tis one of the best discretions of a oman as ever I did look upon

PAGE
And did he send you both these letters at an instant

MISTRESS PAGE
Within a quarter of an hour

FORD
Pardon me wife Henceforth do what thou wilt
I rather will suspect the sun with cold
Than thee with wantonness Now doth thy honour stand
In him that was of late an heretic
As firm as faith

PAGE
Tis well tis well no more
Be not as extreme in submission as in offence
But let our plot go forward Let our wives
Yet once again to make us public sport
Appoint a meeting with this old fat fellow
Where we may take him and disgrace him for it

FORD
There is no better way than that they spoke of

PAGE
How To send him word theyll meet him in the park at midnight Fie
fie hell never come

EVANS
You say he has been thrown in the rivers and has been grievously
peaten as an old oman Methinks there should be terrors in him that
he should not come Methinks his flesh is punished he shall have no
desires

PAGE
So think I too

MISTRESS FORD
Devise but how youll use him when he comes
And let us two devise to bring him thither

MISTRESS PAGE
There is an old tale goes that Herne the hunter
Sometime a keeper here in Windsor Forest
Doth all the winter time at still midnight
Walk round about an oak with great ragged horns
And there he blasts the tree and takes the cattle
And makes milchkine yield blood and shakes a chain
In a most hideous and dreadful manner
You have heard of such a spirit and well you know
The superstitious idleheaded eld
Received and did deliver to our age
This tale of Herne the hunter for a truth

PAGE
Why yet there want not many that do fear
In deep of night to walk by this Hernes oak
But what of this

MISTRESS FORD
Marry this is our device
That Falstaff at that oak shall meet with us
Disguised like Herne with huge horns on his head

PAGE
Well let it not be doubted but hell come
And in this shape when you have brought him thither
What shall be done with him What is your plot

MISTRESS PAGE
That likewise have we thought upon and thus
Nan Page my daughter and my little son
And three or four more of their growth well dress
Like urchins oafs and fairies green and white
With rounds of waxen tapers on their heads
And rattles in their hands Upon a sudden
As Falstaff she and I are newly met
Let them from forth a sawpit rush at once
With some diffused song upon their sight
We two in great amazedness will fly
Then let them all encircle him about
And fairylike to pinch the unclean knight
And ask him why that hour of fairy revel
In their so sacred paths he dares to tread
In shape profane

MISTRESS FORD
And till he tell the truth
Let the supposed fairies pinch him sound
And burn him with their tapers

MISTRESS PAGE
The truth being known
Well all present ourselves dishorn the spirit
And mock him home to Windsor

FORD
The children must
Be practised well to this or theyll neer do t

EVANS
I will teach the children their behaviours and I will be like a
jackanapes also to burn the knight with my taber

FORD
That will be excellent Ill go buy them vizards

MISTRESS PAGE
My Nan shall be the queen of all the fairies
Finely attired in a robe of white

PAGE
That silk will I go buy
Aside And in that time
Shall Master Slender steal my Nan away
And marry her at EtonGo send to Falstaff straight

FORD
Nay Ill to him again in name of Brook
Hell tell me all his purpose Sure hell come

MISTRESS PAGE
Fear not you that Go get us properties
And tricking for our fairies

EVANS
Let us about it It is admirable pleasures and fery honest knaveries

Exeunt Page Ford and Evans

MISTRESS PAGE
Go Mistress Ford
Send quickly to Sir John to know his mind

Exit Mistress Ford

Ill to the Doctor He hath my good will
And none but he to marry with Nan Page
That Slender though well landed is an idiot
And he my husband best of all affects
The Doctor is well moneyed and his friends
Potent at court He none but he shall have her
Though twenty thousand worthier come to crave her

FALSTAFF
I would all the world might be cozened for I have been cozened and
beaten too If it should come to the ear of the court how I have been
transformed and how my transformation hath been washed and cudgelled
they would melt me out of my fat drop by drop and liquor fishermens
boots with me I warrant they would whip me with their fine wits till I
were as crestfallen as a dried pear I never prospered since I forswore
myself at primero Well if my wind were but long enough I would
repent

FALSTAFF
The devil take one party and his dam the other and so they shall be
both bestowed I have suffered more for their sakes more than the
villainous inconstancy of mans disposition is able to bear

MISTRESS QUICKLY
And have not they suffered Yes I warrant speciously one of them
Mistress Ford good heart is beaten black and blue that you cannot
see a white spot about her

FALSTAFF
What tellst thou me of black and blue I was beaten myself into all the
colours of the rainbow and was like to be apprehended for the witch of
Brentford But that my admirable dexterity of wit my counterfeiting
the action of an old woman delivered me the knave constable had set
me i the stocks i the common stocks for a witch

MISTRESS QUICKLY

And as I am a gentleman Ill give thee
A hundred pound in gold more than your loss

HOST
I will hear you Master Fenton and I will at the least keep your
counsel

FENTON
From time to time I have acquainted you
With the dear love I bear to fair Anne Page
Who mutually hath answered my affection
So far forth as herself might be her chooser
Even to my wish I have a letter from her
Of such contents as you will wonder at
The mirth whereof so larded with my matter
That neither singly can be manifested
Without the show of both wherein fat Falstaff
Hath a great scene the image of the jest
Ill show you here at large Hark good mine host
Tonight at Hernes oak just twixt twelve and one
Must my sweet Nan present the Fairy Queen
The purpose why is herein which disguise
While other jests are something rank on foot
Her father hath commanded her to slip
Away with Slender and with him at Eton
Immediately to marry She hath consented Now sir
Her mother even strong against that match
And firm for Doctor Caius hath appointed
That he shall likewise shuffle her away
While other sports are tasking of their minds
And at the deanry where a priest attends
Straight marry her To this her mothers plot
She seemingly obedient likewise hath
Made promise to the doctor Now thus it rests
Her father means she shall be all in white
And in that habit when Slender sees his time
To take her by the hand and bid her go
She shall go with him Her mother hath intended
The better to denote her to the doctor
For they must all be masked and vizarded
That quaint in green she shall be loose enrobed
With ribbons pendant flaring bout her head
And when the doctor spies his vantage ripe
To pinch her by the hand and on that token
The maid hath given consent to go with him

HOST
Which means she to deceive father or mother

FENTON
Both my good host to go along with me
And here it rests that youll procure the vicar
To stay for me at church twixt twelve and one
And in the lawful name of marrying
To give our hearts united ceremony

HOST
Well husband your device Ill to the vicar
Bring you the maid you shall not lack a priest

Besides Ill make a present recompense

CAIUS

MISTRESS PAGE
Fare you well sir

Exit Caius

My husband will not rejoice so much at the abuse of Falstaff as he will
chafe at the doctors marrying my daughter But tis no matter Better
a little chiding than a great deal of heartbreak

MISTRESS FORD
Where is Nan now and her troop of fairies and the Welsh devil Hugh

MISTRESS PAGE
They are all couched in a pit hard by Hernes oak with obscured
lights which at the very instant of Falstaffs and our meeting they
will at once display to the night

MISTRESS FORD
That cannot choose but amaze him

MISTRESS PAGE
If he be not amazed he will be mocked if he be amazed he will every
way be mocked

MISTRESS FORD
Well betray him finely

Those that betray them do no treachery

SCENE V Another part of the Park

Enter Falstaff wearing a bucks head

FALSTAFF
The Windsor bell hath struck twelve the minute draws on Now the
hotblooded gods assist me Remember Jove thou wast a bull for thy
Europa love set on thy horns O powerful love that in some respects
makes a beast a man in some other a man a beast You were also
Jupiter a swan for the love of Leda O omnipotent love how near the
god drew to the complexion of a goose A fault done first in the form
of a beast O Jove a beastly fault And then another fault in the
semblance of a fowl think ont Jove a foul fault When gods have hot
backs what shall poor men do For me I am here a Windsor stag and
the fattest I think i the forest Send me a cool ruttime Jove or
who can blame me to piss my tallow Who comes here My doe

Enter Mistress Ford and Mistress Page

He embraces her

MISTRESS FORD

myself my shoulders for the fellow of this walk and my horns I
bequeath your husbands Am I a woodman ha Speak I like Herne the
hunter Why now is Cupid a child of conscience he makes restitution
As I am a true spirit welcome

A noise of horns within

MISTRESS PAGE
Alas what noise

MISTRESS FORD
Heaven forgive our sins

FALSTAFF
What should this be

MISTRESS FORD and MISTRESS PAGE
Away away

They run off

FALSTAFF
I think the devil will not have me damned lest the oil thats in me
should set hell on fire he would never else cross me thus

Enter Mistress Quickly as the Queen of Fairies Sir Hugh Evans as a
Satyr Pistol as Hobgoblin Anne Page and children as Fairies carrying
tapers

MISTRESS QUICKLY
Fairies black grey green and white
You moonshine revellers and shades of night
You orphan heirs of fixed destiny
Attend your office and your quality
Crier Hobgoblin make the fairy oyes

PISTOL
Elves list your names silence you airy toys
Cricket to Windsor chimneys shalt thou leap
Where fires thou findst unraked and hearths unswept
There pinch the maids as blue as bilberry
Our radiant queen hates sluts and sluttery

FALSTAFF
They are fairies he that speaks to them shall die
Ill wink and couch No man their works must eye

Lies down upon his face

EVANS
Wheres Bead Go you and where you find a maid
That ere she sleep has thrice her prayers said
Rein up the organs of her fantasy
Sleep she as sound as careless infancy
But those as sleep and think not on their sins
Pinch them arms legs backs shoulders sides and shins

MISTRESS QUICKLY
About about
Search Windsor castle elves within and out
Strew good luck oafs on every sacred room
That it may stand till the perpetual doom
In state as wholesome as in state tis fit
Worthy the owner and the owner it
The several chairs of order look you scour
With juice of balm and every precious flower
Each fair instalment coat and several crest
With loyal blazon evermore be blest
And nightly meadowfairies look you sing
Like to the Garters compass in a ring
Th expressure that it bears green let it be
More fertilefresh than all the field to see
And Honi soit qui mal y pense write
In emrald tufts flowers purple blue and white
Like sapphire pearl and rich embroidery
Buckled below fair knighthoods bending knee
Fairies use flowers for their charactery
Away disperse But till tis one oclock
Our dance of custom round about the oak
Of Herne the hunter let us not forget

EVANS
Pray you lock hand in hand yourselves in order set
And twenty glowworms shall our lanterns be
To guide our measure round about the tree
But stay I smell a man of middle earth

FALSTAFF
Heavens defend me from that Welsh fairy lest he transform me to a
piece of cheese

PISTOL
Vile worm thou wast oerlooked even in thy birth

MISTRESS QUICKLY
With trialfire touch me his fingerend
If he be chaste the flame will back descend
And turn him to no pain but if he start
It is the flesh of a corrupted heart

PISTOL
A trial come

EVANS
Come will this wood take fire

They put the tapers to his fingers and he starts

FALSTAFF
O o o

MISTRESS QUICKLY
Corrupt corrupt and tainted in desire
About him fairies sing a scornful rhyme
And as you trip still pinch him to your time

SONG
Fie on sinful fantasy
Fie on lust and luxury
Lust is but a bloody fire
Kindled with unchaste desire
Fed in heart whose flames aspire
As thoughts do blow them higher and higher
Pinch him fairies mutually
Pinch him for his villainy
Pinch him and burn him and turn him about
Till candles and starlight and moonshine be out

During the song they pinch him and Doctor Caius comes one way and
steals away a boy in green and Slender another way takes a boy in
white Fenton comes in and steals away Anne Page A noise of hunting is
heard within and all the fairies run away Falstaff pulls off his
bucks head and rises up

Enter Page Ford Mistress Page and Mistress Ford

PAGE
Nay do not fly I think we have watched you now
Will none but Herne the hunter serve your turn

MISTRESS PAGE
I pray you come hold up the jest no higher
Now good Sir John how like you Windsor wives
See you these husband

She points to the horns

Do not these fair yokes
Become the forest better than the town

FORD
Now sir whos a cuckold now Master Brook Falstaffs a knave a
cuckoldly knave Here are his horns Master Brook And Master Brook
he hath enjoyed nothing of Fords but his buckbasket his cudgel and
twenty pounds of money which must be paid to Master Brook His horses
are arrested for it Master Brook

MISTRESS FORD
Sir John we have had ill luck we could never meet I will never take
you for my love again but I will always count you my deer

FALSTAFF
I do begin to perceive that I am made an ass

FORD
Ay and an ox too Both the proofs are extant

FALSTAFF
And these are not fairies I was three or four times in the thought
they were not fairies and yet the guiltiness of my mind the sudden
surprise of my powers drove the grossness of the foppery into a
received belief in despite of the teeth of all rhyme and reason that
they were fairies See now how wit may be made a JackaLent when tis
upon ill employment

EVANS
Sir John Falstaff serve Got and leave your desires and fairies will
not pinse you

FORD
Well said fairy Hugh

EVANS
And leave you your jealousies too I pray you

FORD
I will never mistrust my wife again till thou art able to woo her in
good English

FALSTAFF
Have I laid my brain in the sun and dried it that it wants matter to
prevent so gross oerreaching as this Am I ridden with a Welsh goat
too Shall I have a coxcomb of frieze Tis time I were choked with a
piece of toasted cheese

EVANS
Seese is not good to give putter Your belly is all putter

FALSTAFF
Seese and putter Have I lived to stand at the taunt of one that
makes fritters of English This is enough to be the decay of lust and
latewalking through the realm

MISTRESS PAGE
Why Sir John do you think though we would have thrust virtue out of
our hearts by the head and shoulders and have given ourselves without
scruple to hell that ever the devil could have made you our delight

FORD
What a hodgepudding A bag of flax

MISTRESS PAGE
A puffed man

PAGE
Old cold withered and of intolerable entrails

FORD
And one that is as slanderous as Satan

PAGE
And as poor as Job

FORD
And as wicked as his wife

EVANS
And given to fornications and to taverns and sack and wine and
metheglins and to drinkings and swearings and starings pribbles and
prabbles

FALSTAFF
Well I am your theme You have the start of me I am dejected I am
not able to answer the Welsh flannel Ignorance itself is a plummet
oer me Use me as you will

FORD
Marry sir well bring you to Windsor to one Master Brook that you
have cozened of money to whom you should have been a pander Over and
above that you have suffered I think to repay that money will be a
biting affliction

PAGE
Yet be cheerful knight Thou shalt eat a posset tonight at my house
where I will desire thee to laugh at my wife that now laughs at thee
Tell her Master Slender hath married her daughter

MISTRESS PAGE
Aside Doctors doubt that If Anne Page be my daughter she is by
this Doctor Caius wife

Enter Slender

SLENDER
Whoa ho ho father Page

PAGE
Son how now How now son have you dispatched

SLENDER
Dispatched Ill make the best in Gloucestershire know ont Would I

PAGE
Of what son

SLENDER
I came yonder at Eton to marry Mistress Anne Page and shes a great
lubberly boy If it had not been i the church I would have swinged
him or he should have swinged me If I did not think it had been Anne
Page would I might never stir And tis a postmasters boy

PAGE
Upon my life then you took the wrong

SLENDER
What need you tell me that I think so when I took a boy for a girl
If I had been married to him for all he was in womans apparel I
would not have had him

PAGE
Why this is your own folly Did not I tell you how you should know my
daughter by her garments

SLENDER
I went to her in white and cried mum and she cried budget as Anne
and I had appointed and yet it was not Anne but a postmasters boy

MISTRESS PAGE
Good George be not angry I knew of your purpose turned my daughter
into green and indeed she is now with the doctor at the deanery and
there married

PAGE
Now mistress how chance you went not with Master Slender

MISTRESS PAGE
Why went you not with Master Doctor maid

FENTON
You do amaze her Hear the truth of it
You would have married her most shamefully
Where there was no proportion held in love
The truth is she and I long since contracted
Are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us
Th offence is holy that she hath committed
And this deceit loses the name of craft
Of disobedience or unduteous title
Since therein she doth evitate and shun
A thousand irreligious cursed hours
Which forced marriage would have brought upon her

FORD
Stand not amazed here is no remedy
In love the heavens themselves do guide the state
Money buys lands and wives are sold by fate

FALSTAFF
I am glad though you have taen a special stand to strike at me that
your arrow hath glanced

PAGE
Well what remedy Fenton heaven give thee joy
What cannot be eschewed must be embraced

FALSTAFF
When nightdogs run all sorts of deer are chased

MISTRESS PAGE
Well I will muse no furtherMaster Fenton
Heaven give you many many merry days
Good husband let us every one go home
And laugh this sport oer by a country fire
Sir John and all

FORD
Let it be so Sir John
To Master Brook you yet shall hold your word
For he tonight shall lie with Mistress Ford

Exeunt
