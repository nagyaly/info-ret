ACT I

SCENE I London The Parliament House


Alarum Enter Duke of York Edward Richard Norfolk Montague Warwick
and Soldiers all wearing the white rose

WARWICK
I wonder how the King escaped our hands

YORK
While we pursued the horsemen of the north
He slyly stole away and left his men
Whereat the great Lord of Northumberland
Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat
Cheered up the drooping army and himself
Lord Clifford and Lord Stafford all abreast
Charged our main battles front and breaking in
Were by the swords of common soldiers slain

EDWARD
Lord Staffords father Duke of Buckingham
Is either slain or wounded dangerous
I cleft his beaver with a downright blow
That this is true father behold his blood

Showing his bloody sword

MONTAGUE
And brother heres the Earl of Wiltshires blood

To York showing his

Whom I encountered as the battles joined

RICHARD
Speak thou for me and tell them what I did

Throwing down the Duke of Somersets head

YORK
Richard hath best deserved of all my sons
But is your Grace dead my Lord of Somerset

NORFOLK
Such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt

RICHARD
Thus do I hope to shake King Henrys head

WARWICK
And so do I Victorious Prince of York
Before I see thee seated in that throne
Which now the house of Lancaster usurps
I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close
This is the palace of the fearful king
And this the regal seat Possess it York
For this is thine and not King Henrys heirs

YORK
Assist me then sweet Warwick and I will
For hither we have broken in by force

NORFOLK
Well all assist you he that flies shall die

YORK
Thanks gentle Norfolk Stay by me my lords
And soldiers stay and lodge by me this night

WARWICK
And when the King comes offer him no violence
Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce

They retire

YORK
The Queen this day here holds her parliament
But little thinks we shall be of her council
By words or blows here let us win our right

RICHARD
Armed as we are lets stay within this house

WARWICK
The bloody parliament shall this be called
Unless Plantagenet Duke of York be king
And bashful Henry deposed whose cowardice
Hath made us bywords to our enemies

YORK
Then leave me not my lords be resolute
I mean to take possession of my right

WARWICK
Neither the King nor he that loves him best
The proudest he that holds up Lancaster
Dares stir a wing if Warwick shake his bells
Ill plant Plantagenet root him up who dares
Resolve thee Richard claim the English crown

Warwick leads York to the throne who seats himself

Flourish Enter King Henry Clifford Northumberland Westmoreland
Exeter and the rest all wearing the red rose

KING HENRY
My lords look where the sturdy rebel sits
Even in the chair of state Belike he means
Backed by the power of Warwick that false peer
To aspire unto the crown and reign as king
Earl of Northumberland he slew thy father
And thine Lord Clifford and you both have vowed revenge
On him his sons his favourites and his friends

NORTHUMBERLAND
If I be not heavens be revenged on me

CLIFFORD
The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel

WESTMORELAND
What shall we suffer this Lets pluck him down
My heart for anger burns I cannot brook it

KING HENRY
Be patient gentle Earl of Westmoreland

CLIFFORD
Patience is for poltroons such as he
He durst not sit there had your father lived
My gracious lord here in the parliament
Let us assail the family of York

NORTHUMBERLAND
Well hast thou spoken cousin Be it so

KING HENRY
Ah know you not the city favours them
And they have troops of soldiers at their beck

EXETER
But when the Duke is slain theyll quickly fly

KING HENRY
Far be the thought of this from Henrys heart
To make a shambles of the Parliament House
Cousin of Exeter frowns words and threats
Shall be the war that Henry means to use

They advance to the Duke

Thou factious Duke of York descend my throne
And kneel for grace and mercy at my feet
I am thy sovereign

YORK
I am thine

EXETER
For shame come down He made thee Duke of York

YORK
Twas my inheritance as the earldom was

EXETER
Thy father was a traitor to the crown

WARWICK
Exeter thou art a traitor to the crown
In following this usurping Henry

CLIFFORD
Whom should he follow but his natural king

WARWICK
True Clifford thats Richard Duke of York

KING HENRY
And shall I stand and thou sit in my throne

YORK
It must and shall be so Content thyself

WARWICK
Be Duke of Lancaster Let him be king

WESTMORELAND
He is both King and Duke of Lancaster
And that the Lord of Westmoreland shall maintain

WARWICK
And Warwick shall disprove it You forget
That we are those which chased you from the field
And slew your fathers and with colours spread
Marched through the city to the palace gates

NORTHUMBERLAND
Yes Warwick I remember it to my grief
And by his soul thou and thy house shall rue it

WESTMORELAND
Plantagenet of thee and these thy sons
Thy kinsmen and thy friends Ill have more lives
Than drops of blood were in my fathers veins

CLIFFORD
Urge it no more lest that instead of words
I send thee Warwick such a messenger
As shall revenge his death before I stir

WARWICK
Poor Clifford how I scorn his worthless threats

YORK
Will you we show our title to the crown
If not our swords shall plead it in the field

KING HENRY
What title hast thou traitor to the crown
Thy father was as thou art Duke of York
Thy grandfather Roger Mortimer Earl of March
I am the son of Henry the Fifth
Who made the Dauphin and the French to stoop
And seized upon their towns and provinces

WARWICK
Talk not of France sith thou hast lost it all

KING HENRY
The Lord Protector lost it and not I
When I was crowned I was but nine months old

RICHARD
You are old enough now and yet methinks you lose
Father tear the crown from the usurpers head

EDWARD
Sweet father do so set it on your head

MONTAGUE
Good brother as thou lovst and honourest arms
Lets fight it out and not stand cavilling thus

RICHARD
Sound drums and trumpets and the King will fly

YORK
Sons peace

KING HENRY
Peace thou and give King Henry leave to speak

WARWICK
Plantagenet shall speak first Hear him lords
And be you silent and attentive too
For he that interrupts him shall not live

KING HENRY
Thinkst thou that I will leave my kingly throne
Wherein my grandsire and my father sat
No First shall war unpeople this my realm
Ay and their colours often borne in France
And now in England to our hearts great sorrow
Shall be my windingsheet Why faint you lords
My titles good and better far than his

WARWICK
Prove it Henry and thou shalt be king

KING HENRY
Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown

YORK
Twas by rebellion against his king

KING HENRY
Aside I know not what to say my titles weak
Tell me may not a king adopt an heir

YORK
What then

KING HENRY
An if he may then am I lawful king
For Richard in the view of many lords
Resigned the crown to Henry the Fourth
Whose heir my father was and I am his

YORK
He rose against him being his sovereign
And made him to resign his crown perforce

WARWICK
Suppose my lords he did it unconstrained
Think you twere prejudicial to his crown

EXETER
No for he could not so resign his crown
But that the next heir should succeed and reign

KING HENRY
Art thou against us Duke of Exeter

EXETER
His is the right and therefore pardon me

YORK
Why whisper you my lords and answer not

EXETER
My conscience tells me he is lawful king

KING HENRY
Aside All will revolt from me and turn to him

NORTHUMBERLAND
Plantagenet for all the claim thou layst
Think not that Henry shall be so deposed

WARWICK
Deposed he shall be in despite of all

NORTHUMBERLAND
Thou art deceived Tis not thy southern power
Of Essex Norfolk Suffolk nor of Kent
Which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud
Can set the Duke up in despite of me

CLIFFORD
King Henry be thy title right or wrong
Lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defence
May that ground gape and swallow me alive
Where I shall kneel to him that slew my father

KING HENRY
O Clifford how thy words revive my heart

YORK
Henry of Lancaster resign thy crown
What mutter you or what conspire you lords

WARWICK
Do right unto this princely Duke of York
Or I will fill the house with armed men
And over the chair of state where now he sits
Write up his title with usurping blood

He stamps with his foot and the Soldiers show themselves

KING HENRY
My Lord of Warwick hear but one word
Let me for this my lifetime reign as king

YORK
Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs
And thou shalt reign in quiet while thou livst

KING HENRY
I am content Richard Plantagenet
Enjoy the kingdom after my decease

CLIFFORD
What wrong is this unto the Prince your son

WARWICK
What good is this to England and himself

WESTMORELAND
Base fearful and despairing Henry

CLIFFORD
How hast thou injured both thyself and us

WESTMORELAND
I cannot stay to hear these articles

NORTHUMBERLAND
Nor I

CLIFFORD
Come cousin let us tell the Queen these news

WESTMORELAND
Farewell fainthearted and degenerate king
In whose cold blood no spark of honour bides

NORTHUMBERLAND
Be thou a prey unto the house of York
And die in bands for this unmanly deed

CLIFFORD
In dreadful war mayst thou be overcome
Or live in peace abandoned and despised

Exeunt Westmoreland Northumberland and Clifford

WARWICK
Turn this way Henry and regard them not

EXETER
They seek revenge and therefore will not yield

KING HENRY
Ah Exeter

WARWICK
Why should you sigh my lord

KING HENRY
Not for myself Lord Warwick but my son
Whom I unnaturally shall disinherit
But be it as it may To York I here entail
The crown to thee and to thine heirs for ever
Conditionally that here thou take an oath
To cease this civil war and whilst I live
To honour me as thy king and sovereign
And neither by treason nor hostility
To seek to put me down and reign thyself

YORK
This oath I willingly take and will perform

Coming from the throne

WARWICK
Long live King Henry Plantagenet embrace him

KING HENRY
And long live thou and these thy forward sons

YORK
Now York and Lancaster are reconciled

EXETER
Accursed be he that seeks to make them foes

Sennet Here they come down

YORK
Farewell my gracious lord Ill to my castle

WARWICK
And Ill keep London with my soldiers

NORFOLK
And I to Norfolk with my followers

MONTAGUE
And I unto the sea from whence I came

Exeunt York and his Sons Warwick Norfolk Montague and their
Soldiers

KING HENRY
And I with grief and sorrow to the court

Enter Queen Margaret and the Prince of Wales

EXETER
Here comes the Queen whose looks bewray her anger
Ill steal away

KING HENRY
Exeter so will I

Going

QUEEN MARGARET
Nay go not from me I will follow thee

KING HENRY
Be patient gentle Queen and I will stay

QUEEN MARGARET
Who can be patient in such extremes
Ah wretched man would I had died a maid
And never seen thee never borne thee son
Seeing thou hast proved so unnatural a father
Hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus
Hadst thou but loved him half so well as I
Or felt that pain which I did for him once
Or nourished him as I did with my blood
Thou wouldst have left thy dearest heartblood there
Rather than have made that savage duke thine heir
And disinherited thine only son

PRINCE EDWARD
Father you cannot disinherit me
If you be king why should not I succeed

KING HENRY
Pardon me Margaret pardon me sweet son
The Earl of Warwick and the Duke enforced me

QUEEN MARGARET
Enforced thee Art thou King and wilt be forced
I shame to hear thee speak Ah timorous wretch
Thou hast undone thyself thy son and me
And given unto the house of York such head
As thou shalt reign but by their sufferance
To entail him and his heirs unto the crown
What is it but to make thy sepulchre
And creep into it far before thy time
Warwick is Chancellor and the lord of Calais
Stern Falconbridge commands the narrow seas
The Duke is made Protector of the realm
And yet shalt thou be safe Such safety finds
The trembling lamb environed with wolves
Had I been there which am a silly woman
The soldiers should have tossed me on their pikes
Before I would have granted to that act
But thou preferst thy life before thine honour
And seeing thou dost I here divorce myself
Both from thy table Henry and thy bed
Until that act of parliament be repealed
Whereby my son is disinherited
The northern lords that have forsworn thy colours
Will follow mine if once they see them spread
And spread they shall be to thy foul disgrace
And utter ruin of the house of York
Thus do I leave thee Come son lets away
Our army is ready come well after them

KING HENRY
Stay gentle Margaret and hear me speak

QUEEN MARGARET
Thou hast spoke too much already Get thee gone

KING HENRY
Gentle son Edward thou wilt stay with me

QUEEN MARGARET
Ay to be murdered by his enemies

PRINCE EDWARD
When I return with victory from the field
Ill see your Grace Till then Ill follow her

QUEEN MARGARET
Come son away we may not linger thus

Exeunt Queen Margaret and the Prince

KING HENRY
Poor queen How love to me and to her son
Hath made her break out into terms of rage
Revenged may she be on that hateful Duke
Whose haughty spirit winged with desire
Will cost my crown and like an empty eagle
Tire on the flesh of me and of my son
The loss of those three lords torments my heart
Ill write unto them and entreat them fair
Come cousin you shall be the messenger

EXETER
And I I hope shall reconcile them all

Flourish Exeunt

SCENE II Sandal Castle

Enter Edward Richard and Montague

RICHARD
Brother though I be youngest give me leave

EDWARD
No I can better play the orator

MONTAGUE
But I have reasons strong and forcible

Enter the Duke of York

YORK
Why how now sons and brother at a strife
What is your quarrel How began it first

EDWARD
No quarrel but a slight contention

YORK
About what

RICHARD
About that which concerns your Grace and us
The crown of England father which is yours

YORK
Mine boy Not till King Henry be dead

RICHARD
Your right depends not on his life or death

EDWARD
Now you are heir therefore enjoy it now
By giving the house of Lancaster leave to breathe
It will outrun you father in the end

YORK
I took an oath that he should quietly reign

EDWARD
But for a kingdom any oath may be broken
I would break a thousand oaths to reign one year

RICHARD
No God forbid your Grace should be forsworn

YORK
I shall be if I claim by open war

RICHARD
Ill prove the contrary if youll hear me speak

YORK
Thou canst not son it is impossible

RICHARD
An oath is of no moment being not took
Before a true and lawful magistrate
That hath authority over him that swears
Henry had none but did usurp the place
Then seeing twas he that made you to depose
Your oath my lord is vain and frivolous
Therefore to arms And father do but think
How sweet a thing it is to wear a crown
Within whose circuit is Elysium
And all that poets feign of bliss and joy
Why do we linger thus I cannot rest
Until the white rose that I wear be dyed
Even in the lukewarm blood of Henrys heart

YORK
Richard enough I will be king or die
Brother thou shalt to London presently
And whet on Warwick to this enterprise
Thou Richard shalt to the Duke of Norfolk
And tell him privily of our intent
You Edward shall unto my Lord Cobham
With whom the Kentishmen will willingly rise
In them I trust for they are soldiers
Witty courteous liberal full of spirit
While you are thus employed what resteth more
But that I seek occasion how to rise
And yet the King not privy to my drift
Nor any of the house of Lancaster

Enter a Messenger

But stay What news Why comst thou in such post

MESSENGER
The Queen with all the northern earls and lords
Intend here to besiege you in your castle
She is hard by with twenty thousand men
And therefore fortify your hold my lord

YORK
Ay with my sword What thinkst thou that we fear them
Edward and Richard you shall stay with me
My brother Montague shall post to London
Let noble Warwick Cobham and the rest
Whom we have left protectors of the King
With powerful policy strengthen themselves
And trust not simple Henry nor his oaths

MONTAGUE
Brother I go Ill win them fear it not
And thus most humbly I do take my leave

Exit

Enter Sir John and Sir Hugh Mortimer

YORK
Sir John and Sir Hugh Mortimer mine uncles
You are come to Sandal in a happy hour
The army of the Queen mean to besiege us

SIR JOHN
She shall not need well meet her in the field

YORK
What with five thousand men

RICHARD
Ay with five hundred father for a need
A womans general what should we fear

A march afar off

EDWARD
I hear their drums Lets set our men in order
And issue forth and bid them battle straight

YORK
Five men to twenty Though the odds be great
I doubt not uncle of our victory
Many a battle have I won in France
Whenas the enemy hath been ten to one
Why should I not now have the like success

Alarum Exeunt

SCENE III Plains near Sandal Castle

Alarums Enter Rutland and his Tutor

RUTLAND
Ah whither shall I fly to scape their hands
Ah tutor look where bloody Clifford comes

Enter Clifford and Soldiers

CLIFFORD
Chaplain away Thy priesthood saves thy life
As for the brat of this accursed duke
Whose father slew my father he shall die

TUTOR
And I my lord will bear him company

CLIFFORD
Soldiers away with him

TUTOR
Ah Clifford murder not this innocent child
Lest thou be hated both of God and man

Exit dragged off by Soldiers

CLIFFORD
How now Is he dead already Or is it fear
That makes him close his eyes Ill open them

RUTLAND
So looks the pentup lion oer the wretch
That trembles under his devouring paws
And so he walks insulting oer his prey
And so he comes to rend his limbs asunder
Ah gentle Clifford kill me with thy sword
And not with such a cruel threatning look
Sweet Clifford hear me speak before I die
I am too mean a subject for thy wrath
Be thou revenged on men and let me live

CLIFFORD
In vain thou speakst poor boy my fathers blood
Hath stopped the passage where thy words should enter

RUTLAND
Then let my fathers blood open it again
He is a man and Clifford cope with him

CLIFFORD
Had I thy brethren here their lives and thine
Were not revenge sufficient for me
No if I digged up thy forefathers graves
And hung their rotten coffins up in chains
It could not slake mine ire nor ease my heart
The sight of any of the house of York
Is as a fury to torment my soul
And till I root out their accursed line
And leave not one alive I live in hell
Therefore

Lifting his hand

RUTLAND
O let me pray before I take my death
To thee I pray sweet Clifford pity me

CLIFFORD
Such pity as my rapiers point affords

RUTLAND
I never did thee harm why wilt thou slay me

CLIFFORD
Thy father hath

RUTLAND
But twas ere I was born
Thou hast one son for his sake pity me
Lest in revenge thereof sith God is just
He be as miserably slain as I
Ah let me live in prison all my days
And when I give occasion of offence
Then let me die for now thou hast no cause

CLIFFORD
No cause Thy father slew my father therefore die

Clifford stabs him

RUTLAND
Di faciant laudis summa sit ista tuae

Dies

CLIFFORD
Plantagenet I come Plantagenet
And this thy sons blood cleaving to my blade
Shall rust upon my weapon till thy blood
Congealed with this do make me wipe off both

Exit

SCENE IV The Same

Alarum Enter Richard Duke of York

YORK
The army of the Queen hath got the field
My uncles both are slain in rescuing me
And all my followers to the eager foe
Turn back and fly like ships before the wind
Or lambs pursued by hungerstarved wolves
My sons God knows what hath bechanced them
But this I know they have demeaned themselves
Like men born to renown by life or death
Three times did Richard make a lane to me
And thrice cried Courage father fight it out
And full as oft came Edward to my side
With purple falchion painted to the hilt
In blood of those that had encountered him
And when the hardiest warriors did retire
Richard cried Charge and give no foot of ground
And cried A crown or else a glorious tomb
A sceptre or an earthly sepulchre
With this we charged again but out alas
We budged again as I have seen a swan
With bootless labour swim against the tide
And spend her strength with overmatching waves

A short alarum within

Ah hark the fatal followers do pursue
And I am faint and cannot fly their fury
And were I strong I would not shun their fury
The sands are numbered that makes up my life
Here must I stay and here my life must end

Enter Queen Margaret Clifford Northumberland the young Prince Edward
and Soldiers

Come bloody Clifford rough Northumberland
I dare your quenchless fury to more rage
I am your butt and I abide your shot

NORTHUMBERLAND
Yield to our mercy proud Plantagenet

CLIFFORD
Ay to such mercy as his ruthless arm
With downright payment showed unto my father
Now Phathon hath tumbled from his car
And made an evening at the noontide prick

YORK
My ashes as the phoenix may bring forth
A bird that will revenge upon you all
And in that hope I throw mine eyes to heaven
Scorning whateer you can afflict me with
Why come you not What multitudes and fear

CLIFFORD
So cowards fight when they can fly no further
So doves do peck the falcons piercing talons
So desperate thieves all hopeless of their lives
Breathe out invectives gainst the officers

YORK
O Clifford but bethink thee once again
And in thy thought oerrun my former time
And if thou canst for blushing view this face
And bite thy tongue that slanders him with cowardice
Whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this

CLIFFORD
I will not bandy with thee word for word
But buckle with thee blows twice two for one

QUEEN MARGARET
Hold valiant Clifford for a thousand causes
I would prolong awhile the traitors life
Wrath makes him deaf speak thou Northumberland

NORTHUMBERLAND
Hold Clifford do not honour him so much
To prick thy finger though to wound his heart
What valour were it when a cur doth grin
For one to thrust his hand between his teeth
When he might spurn him with his foot away
It is wars prize to take all vantages
And ten to one is no impeach of valour

They lay hands on York who struggles

CLIFFORD
Ay ay so strives the woodcock with the gin

NORTHUMBERLAND
So doth the cony struggle in the net

York is taken prisoner

YORK
So triumph thieves upon their conquered booty
So true men yield with robbers so oermatched

NORTHUMBERLAND
What would your Grace have done unto him now

QUEEN MARGARET
Brave warriors Clifford and Northumberland
Come make him stand upon this molehill here
That raught at mountains with outstretched arms
Yet parted but the shadow with his hand
What was it you that would be Englands king
Was t you that revelled in our parliament
And made a preachment of your high descent
Where are your mess of sons to back you now
The wanton Edward and the lusty George
And wheres that valiant crookback prodigy
Dicky your boy that with his grumbling voice
Was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies
Or with the rest where is your darling Rutland
Look York I stained this napkin with the blood
That valiant Clifford with his rapiers point
Made issue from the bosom of the boy
And if thine eyes can water for his death
I give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal
Alas poor York but that I hate thee deadly
I should lament thy miserable state
I prithee grieve to make me merry York
Stamp rave and fret that I may sing and dance
What hath thy fiery heart so parched thine entrails
That not a tear can fall for Rutlands death
Why art thou patient man Thou shouldst be mad
And I to make thee mad do mock thee thus
Stamp rave and fret that I may sing and dance
Thou wouldst be feed I see to make me sport
York cannot speak unless he wear a crown
A crown for York And lords bow low to him
Hold you his hands whilst I do set it on

Putting a paper crown on his head

Ay marry sir now looks he like a king
Ay this is he that took King Henrys chair
And this is he was his adopted heir
But how is it that great Plantagenet
Is crowned so soon and broke his solemn oath
As I bethink me you should not be king
Till our King Henry had shook hands with Death
And will you pale your head in Henrys glory
And rob his temples of the diadem
Now in his life against your holy oath
O tis a fault too too unpardonable
Off with the crown and with the crown his head
And whilst we breathe take time to do him dead

CLIFFORD
That is my office for my fathers sake

QUEEN MARGARET
Nay stay lets hear the orisons he makes

YORK
Shewolf of France but worse than wolves of France
Whose tongue more poisons than the adders tooth
How illbeseeming is it in thy sex
To triumph like an Amazonian trull
Upon their woes whom Fortune captivates
But that thy face is vizardlike unchanging
Made impudent with use of evil deeds
I would assay proud queen to make thee blush
To tell thee whence thou camst of whom derived
Were shame enough to shame thee wert thou not shameless
Thy father bears the type of King of Naples
Of both the Sicils and Jerusalem
Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman
Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult
It needs not nor it boots thee not proud queen
Unless the adage must be verified
That beggars mounted run their horse to death
Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud
But God he knows thy share thereof is small
Tis virtue that doth make them most admired
The contrary doth make thee wondered at
Tis government that makes them seem divine
The want thereof makes thee abominable
Thou art as opposite to every good
As the Antipodes are unto us
Or as the south to the Septentrion
O tigers heart wrapped in a womans hide
How couldst thou drain the lifeblood of the child
To bid the father wipe his eyes withal
And yet be seen to bear a womans face
Women are soft mild pitiful and flexible
Thou stern obdurate flinty rough remorseless
Bidst thou me rage Why now thou hast thy wish
Wouldst have me weep Why now thou hast thy will
For raging wind blows up incessant showers
And when the rage allays the rain begins
These tears are my sweet Rutlands obsequies
And every drop cries vengeance for his death
Gainst thee fell Clifford and thee false Frenchwoman

NORTHUMBERLAND
Beshrew me but his passion moves me so
That hardly can I check my eyes from tears

YORK
That face of his the hungry cannibals
Would not have touched would not have stained with blood
But you are more inhuman more inexorable
O ten times more than tigers of Hyrcania
See ruthless queen a hapless fathers tears
This cloth thou dippedst in blood of my sweet boy
And I with tears do wash the blood away
Keep thou the napkin and go boast of this
And if thou tellst the heavy story right
Upon my soul the hearers will shed tears
Yea even my foes will shed fastfalling tears
And say Alas it was a piteous deed
There take the crown and with the crown my curse
And in thy need such comfort come to thee
As now I reap at thy too cruel hand
Hardhearted Clifford take me from the world
My soul to heaven my blood upon your heads

NORTHUMBERLAND
Had he been slaughterman to all my kin
I should not for my life but weep with him
To see how inly sorrow gripes his soul

QUEEN MARGARET
What weepingripe my Lord Northumberland
Think but upon the wrong he did us all
And that will quickly dry thy melting tears

CLIFFORD
Heres for my oath heres for my fathers death

Stabbing him

QUEEN MARGARET
And heres to right our gentlehearted king

Stabbing him

YORK
Open thy gate of mercy gracious God
My soul flies through these wounds to seek out Thee

Dies

QUEEN MARGARET
Off with his head and set it on York gates
So York may overlook the town of York

Flourish Exeunt




ACT II

SCENE I A plain near Mortimers Cross in Herefordshire


A march Enter Edward and Richard and their power

EDWARD
I wonder how our princely father scaped
Or whether he be scaped away or no
From Cliffords and Northumberlands pursuit
Had he been taen we should have heard the news
Had he been slain we should have heard the news
Or had he scaped methinks we should have heard
The happy tidings of his good escape
How fares my brother Why is he so sad

RICHARD
I cannot joy until I be resolved
Where our right valiant father is become
I saw him in the battle range about
And watched him how he singled Clifford forth
Methought he bore him in the thickest troop
As doth a lion in a herd of neat
Or as a bear encompassed round with dogs
Who having pinched a few and made them cry
The rest stand all aloof and bark at him
So fared our father with his enemies
So fled his enemies my warlike father
Methinks tis pride enough to be his son
See how the morning opes her golden gates
And takes her farewell of the glorious sun
How well resembles it the prime of youth
Trimmed like a younker prancing to his love

EDWARD
Dazzle mine eyes or do I see three suns

RICHARD
Three glorious suns each one a perfect sun
Not separated with the racking clouds
But severed in a pale clearshining sky
See see they join embrace and seem to kiss
As if they vowed some league inviolable
Now are they but one lamp one light one sun
In this the heaven figures some event

EDWARD
Tis wondrous strange the like yet never heard of
I think it cites us brother to the field
That we the sons of brave Plantagenet
Each one already blazing by our meeds
Should notwithstanding join our lights together
And overshine the earth as this the world
Whateer it bodes henceforward will I bear
Upon my target three fair shining suns

RICHARD
Nay bear three daughters by your leave I speak it
You love the breeder better than the male

Enter a Messenger blowing

But what art thou whose heavy looks foretell
Some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue

MESSENGER
Ah one that was a woeful lookeron
When as the noble Duke of York was slain
Your princely father and my loving lord

EDWARD
O speak no more for I have heard too much

RICHARD
Say how he died for I will hear it all

MESSENGER
Environed he was with many foes
And stood against them as the hope of Troy
Against the Greeks that would have entered Troy
But Hercules himself must yield to odds
And many strokes though with a little axe
Hews down and fell the hardesttimbered oak
By many hands your father was subdued
But only slaughtered by the ireful arm
Of unrelenting Clifford and the Queen
Who crowned the gracious duke in high despite
Laughed in his face and when with grief he wept
The ruthless Queen gave him to dry his cheeks
A napkin steeped in the harmless blood
Of sweet young Rutland by rough Clifford slain
And after many scorns many foul taunts
They took his head and on the gates of York
They set the same and there it doth remain
The saddest spectacle that eer I viewed

EDWARD
Sweet Duke of York our prop to lean upon
Now thou art gone we have no staff no stay
O Clifford boisterous Clifford thou hast slain
The flower of Europe for his chivalry
And treacherously hast thou vanquished him
For hand to hand he would have vanquished thee
Now my souls palace is become a prison
Ah would she break from hence that this my body
Might in the ground be closed up in rest
For never henceforth shall I joy again
Never O never shall I see more joy

RICHARD
I cannot weep for all my bodys moisture
Scarce serves to quench my furnaceburning heart
Nor can my tongue unload my hearts great burthen
For selfsame wind that I should speak withal
Is kindling coals that fires all my breast
And burns me up with flames that tears would quench
To weep is to make less the depth of grief
Tears then for babes blows and revenge for me
Richard I bear thy name Ill venge thy death
Or die renowned by attempting it

EDWARD
His name that valiant duke hath left with thee
His dukedom and his chair with me is left

RICHARD
Nay if thou be that princely eagles bird
Show thy descent by gazing gainst the sun
For chair and dukedom throne and kingdom say
Either that is thine or else thou wert not his

March Enter Warwick Marquess Montague and their army

WARWICK
How now fair lords What fare What news abroad

RICHARD
Great Lord of Warwick if we should recount
Our baleful news and at each words deliverance
Stab poniards in our flesh till all were told
The words would add more anguish than the wounds
O valiant lord the Duke of York is slain

EDWARD
O Warwick Warwick that Plantagenet
Which held thee dearly as his souls redemption
Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death

WARWICK
Ten days ago I drowned these news in tears
And now to add more measure to your woes
I come to tell you things sith then befalln
After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought
Where your brave father breathed his latest gasp
Tidings as swiftly as the posts could run
Were brought me of your loss and his depart
I then in London keeper of the King
Mustered my soldiers gathered flocks of friends
And very well appointed as I thought
Marched toward Saint Albans to intercept the Queen
Bearing the King in my behalf along
For by my scouts I was advertised
That she was coming with a full intent
To dash our late decree in Parliament
Touching King Henrys oath and your succession
Short tale to make we at Saint Albans met
Our battles joined and both sides fiercely fought
But whether twas the coldness of the King
Who looked full gently on his warlike Queen
That robbed my soldiers of their heated spleen
Or whether twas report of her success
Or more than common fear of Cliffords rigour
Who thunders to his captives blood and death
I cannot judge but to conclude with truth
Their weapons like to lightning came and went
Our soldiers like the nightowls lazy flight
Or like an idle thresher with a flail
Fell gently down as if they struck their friends
I cheered them up with justice of our cause
With promise of high pay and great rewards
But all in vain they had no heart to fight
And we in them no hope to win the day
So that we fled the King unto the Queen
Lord George your brother Norfolk and myself
In haste posthaste are come to join with you
For in the Marches here we heard you were
Making another head to fight again

EDWARD
Where is the Duke of Norfolk gentle Warwick
And when came George from Burgundy to England

WARWICK
Some six miles off the Duke is with the soldiers
And for your brother he was lately sent
From your kind aunt Duchess of Burgundy
With aid of soldiers to this needful war

RICHARD
Twas odds belike when valiant Warwick fled
Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit
But neer till now his scandal of retire

WARWICK
Nor now my scandal Richard dost thou hear
For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine
Can pluck the diadem from faint Henrys head
And wring the awful sceptre from his fist
Were he as famous and as bold in war
As he is famed for mildness peace and prayer

RICHARD
I know it well Lord Warwick blame me not
Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak
But in this troublous time whats to be done
Shall we go throw away our coats of steel
And wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns
Numbering our AveMaries with our beads
Or shall we on the helmets of our foes
Tell our devotion with revengeful arms
If for the last say ay and to it lords

WARWICK
Why therefore Warwick came to seek you out
And therefore comes my brother Montague
Attend me lords The proud insulting Queen
With Clifford and the haught Northumberland
And of their feather many moe proud birds
Have wrought the easymelting King like wax
He swore consent to your succession
His oath enrolled in the Parliament
And now to London all the crew are gone
To frustrate both his oath and what beside
May make against the house of Lancaster
Their power I think is thirty thousand strong
Now if the help of Norfolk and myself
With all the friends that thou brave Earl of March
Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure
Will but amount to five and twenty thousand
Why via to London will we march amain
And once again bestride our foaming steeds
And once again cry Charge upon our foes
But never once again turn back and fly

RICHARD
Ay now methinks I hear great Warwick speak
Neer may he live to see a sunshine day
That cries Retire if Warwick bid him stay

EDWARD
Lord Warwick on thy shoulder will I lean
And when thou failstas God forbid the hour
Must Edward fall which peril heaven forfend

WARWICK
No longer Earl of March but Duke of York
The next degree is Englands royal throne
For King of England shalt thou be proclaimed
In every borough as we pass along
And he that throws not up his cap for joy
Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head
King Edward valiant Richard Montague
Stay we no longer dreaming of renown
But sound the trumpets and about our task

RICHARD
Then Clifford were thy heart as hard as steel
As thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds
I come to pierce it or to give thee mine

EDWARD
Then strike up drums God and Saint George for us

Enter a Messenger

WARWICK
How now what news

MESSENGER
The Duke of Norfolk sends you word by me
The Queen is coming with a puissant host
And craves your company for speedy counsel

WARWICK
Why then it sorts brave warriors lets away

Exeunt

SCENE II Before York

Flourish Enter King Henry Queen Margaret the Prince of Wales
Clifford and Northumberland with drums and trumpets

QUEEN MARGARET
Welcome my lord to this brave town of York
Yonders the head of that archenemy
That sought to be encompassed with your crown
Doth not the object cheer your heart my lord

KING HENRY
Ay as the rocks cheer them that fear their wrack
To see this sight it irks my very soul
Withhold revenge dear God Tis not my fault
Nor wittingly have I infringed my vow

CLIFFORD
My gracious liege this too much lenity
And harmful pity must be laid aside
To whom do lions cast their gentle looks
Not to the beast that would usurp their den
Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick
Not his that spoils her young before her face
Who scapes the lurking serpents mortal sting
Not he that sets his foot upon her back
The smallest worm will turn being trodden on
And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood
Ambitious York did level at thy crown
Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows
He but a duke would have his son a king
And raise his issue like a loving sire
Thou being a king blest with a goodly son
Didst yield consent to disinherit him
Which argued thee a most unloving father
Unreasonable creatures feed their young
And though mans face be fearful to their eyes
Yet in protection of their tender ones
Who hath not seen them even with those wings
Which sometime they have used with fearful flight
Make war with him that climbed unto their nest
Offering their own lives in their youngs defence
For shame my liege make them your precedent
Were it not pity that this goodly boy
Should lose his birthright by his fathers fault
And long hereafter say unto his child
What my greatgrandfather and grandsire got
My careless father fondly gave away
Ah what a shame were this Look on the boy
And let his manly face which promiseth
Successful fortune steel thy melting heart
To hold thine own and leave thine own with him

KING HENRY
Full well hath Clifford played the orator
Inferring arguments of mighty force
But Clifford tell me didst thou never hear
That things ill got had ever bad success
And happy always was it for that son
Whose father for his hoarding went to hell
Ill leave my son my virtuous deeds behind
And would my father had left me no more
For all the rest is held at such a rate
As brings a thousandfold more care to keep
Than in possession any jot of pleasure
Ah cousin York would thy best friends did know
How it doth grieve me that thy head is here

QUEEN MARGARET
My lord cheer up your spirits our foes are nigh
And this soft courage makes your followers faint
You promised knighthood to our forward son
Unsheathe your sword and dub him presently
Edward kneel down

KING HENRY
Edward Plantagenet arise a knight
And learn this lesson draw thy sword in right

PRINCE EDWARD
My gracious father by your kingly leave
Ill draw it as apparent to the crown
And in that quarrel use it to the death

CLIFFORD
Why that is spoken like a toward prince

Enter a Messenger

MESSENGER
Royal commanders be in readiness
For with a band of thirty thousand men
Comes Warwick backing of the Duke of York
And in the towns as they do march along
Proclaims him king and many fly to him
Darraign your battle for they are at hand

CLIFFORD
I would your highness would depart the field
The Queen hath best success when you are absent

QUEEN MARGARET
Ay good my lord and leave us to our fortune

KING HENRY
Why thats my fortune too therefore Ill stay

NORTHUMBERLAND
Be it with resolution then to fight

PRINCE EDWARD
My royal father cheer these noble lords
And hearten those that fight in your defence
Unsheathe your sword good father cry Saint George

March Enter Edward George Richard Warwick Norfolk Montague and
Soldiers

EDWARD
Now perjured Henry wilt thou kneel for grace
And set thy diadem upon my head
Or bide the mortal fortune of the field

QUEEN MARGARET
Go rate thy minions proud insulting boy
Becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms
Before thy sovereign and thy lawful king

EDWARD
I am his king and he should bow his knee
I was adopted heir by his consent
Since when his oath is broke for as I hear
You that are king though he do wear the crown
Have caused him by new act of Parliament
To blot out me and put his own son in

CLIFFORD
And reason too
Who should succeed the father but the son

RICHARD
Are you there butcher O I cannot speak

CLIFFORD
Ay crookback here I stand to answer thee
Or any he the proudest of thy sort

RICHARD
Twas you that killed young Rutland was it not

CLIFFORD
Ay and old York and yet not satisfied

RICHARD
For Gods sake lords give signal to the fight

WARWICK
What sayst thou Henry wilt thou yield the crown

QUEEN MARGARET
Why how now longtongued Warwick dare you speak
When you and I met at Saint Albans last
Your legs did better service than your hands

WARWICK
Then twas my turn to fly and now tis thine

CLIFFORD
You said so much before and yet you fled

WARWICK
Twas not your valour Clifford drove me thence

NORTHUMBERLAND
No nor your manhood that durst make you stay

RICHARD
Northumberland I hold thee reverently
Break off the parley for scarce I can refrain
The execution of my bigswoln heart
Upon that Clifford that cruel childkiller

CLIFFORD
I slew thy father callst thou him a child

RICHARD
Ay like a dastard and a treacherous coward
As thou didst kill our tender brother Rutland
But ere sunset Ill make thee curse the deed

KING HENRY
Have done with words my lords and hear me speak

QUEEN MARGARET
Defy them then or else hold close thy lips

KING HENRY
I prithee give no limits to my tongue
I am a king and privileged to speak

CLIFFORD
My liege the wound that bred this meeting here
Cannot be cured by words therefore be still

RICHARD
Then executioner unsheathe thy sword
By Him that made us all I am resolved
That Cliffords manhood lies upon his tongue

EDWARD
Say Henry shall I have my right or no
A thousand men have broke their fasts today
That neer shall dine unless thou yield the crown

WARWICK
If thou deny their blood upon thy head
For York in justice puts his armour on

PRINCE EDWARD
If that be right which Warwick says is right
There is no wrong but everything is right

RICHARD
Whoever got thee there thy mother stands
For well I wot thou hast thy mothers tongue

QUEEN MARGARET
But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam
But like a foul misshapen stigmatic
Marked by the Destinies to be avoided
As venom toads or lizards dreadful stings

RICHARD
Iron of Naples hid with English gilt
Whose father bears the title of a king
As if a channel should be called the sea
Shamst thou not knowing whence thou art extraught
To let thy tongue detect thy baseborn heart

EDWARD
A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns
To make this shameless callet know herself
Helen of Greece was fairer far than thou
Although thy husband may be Menelaus
And neer was Agamemnons brother wronged
By that false woman as this king by thee
His father revelled in the heart of France
And tamed the King and made the Dauphin stoop
And had he matched according to his state
He might have kept that glory to this day
But when he took a beggar to his bed
And graced thy poor sire with his bridal day
Even then that sunshine brewed a shower for him
That washed his fathers fortunes forth of France
And heaped sedition on his crown at home
For what hath broached this tumult but thy pride
Hadst thou been meek our title still had slept
And we in pity of the gentle king
Had slipped our claim until another age

GEORGE
But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring
And that thy summer bred us no increase
We set the axe to thy usurping root
And though the edge hath something hit ourselves
Yet know thou since we have begun to strike
Well never leave till we have hewn thee down
Or bathed thy growing with our heated bloods

EDWARD
And in this resolution I defy thee
Not willing any longer conference
Since thou deniest the gentle King to speak
Sound trumpets Let our bloody colours wave
And either victory or else a grave

QUEEN MARGARET
Stay Edward

EDWARD
No wrangling woman well no longer stay
These words will cost ten thousand lives this day

Exeunt

SCENE III A field of battle between Towton and Saxton in Yorkshire

Alarums Excursions Enter Warwick

WARWICK
Forspent with toil as runners with a race
I lay me down a little while to breathe
For strokes received and many blows repaid
Have robbed my strongknit sinews of their strength
And spite of spite needs must I rest awhile

Enter Edward running

EDWARD
Smile gentle heaven or strike ungentle death
For this world frowns and Edwards sun is clouded

WARWICK
How now my lord what hap What hope of good

Enter George

GEORGE
Our hap is loss our hope but sad despair
Our ranks are broke and ruin follows us
What counsel give you Whither shall we fly

EDWARD
Bootless is flight they follow us with wings
And weak we are and cannot shun pursuit

Enter Richard

RICHARD
Ah Warwick why hast thou withdrawn thyself
Thy brothers blood the thirsty earth hath drunk
Broached with the steely point of Cliffords lance
And in the very pangs of death he cried
Like to a dismal clangor heard from far
Warwick revenge Brother revenge my death
So underneath the belly of their steeds
That stained their fetlocks in his smoking blood
The noble gentleman gave up the ghost

WARWICK
Then let the earth be drunken with our blood
Ill kill my horse because I will not fly
Why stand we like softhearted women here
Wailing our losses whiles the foe doth rage
And look upon as if the tragedy
Were played in jest by counterfeiting actors
Here on my knee I vow to God above
Ill never pause again never stand still
Till either death hath closed these eyes of mine
Or Fortune given me measure of revenge

EDWARD
O Warwick I do bend my knee with thine
And in this vow do chain my soul to thine
And ere my knee rise from the earths cold face
I throw my hands mine eyes my heart to Thee
Thou setter up and plucker down of kings
Beseeching Thee if with Thy will it stands
That to my foes this body must be prey
Yet that Thy brazen gates of heaven may ope
And give sweet passage to my sinful soul
Now lords take leave until we meet again
Whereer it be in heaven or in earth

RICHARD
Brother give me thy hand and gentle Warwick
Let me embrace thee in my weary arms
I that did never weep now melt with woe
That winter should cut off our springtime so

WARWICK
Away away Once more sweet lords farewell

GEORGE
Yet let us all together to our troops
And give them leave to fly that will not stay
And call them pillars that will stand to us
And if we thrive promise them such rewards
As victors wear at the Olympian games
This may plant courage in their quailing breasts
For yet is hope of life and victory
Forslow no longer make we hence amain

Exeunt

SCENE IV Another Part of the Field

Excursions Enter Richard and Clifford

RICHARD
Now Clifford I have singled thee alone
Suppose this arm is for the Duke of York
And this for Rutland both bound to revenge
Wert thou environed with a brazen wall

CLIFFORD
Now Richard I am with thee here alone
This is the hand that stabbed thy father York
And this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland
And heres the heart that triumphs in their death
And cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother
To execute the like upon thyself
And so have at thee

They fight Warwick comes Clifford flies

RICHARD
Nay Warwick single out some other chase
For I myself will hunt this wolf to death

Exeunt

SCENE V Another Part of the Field

Enter King Henry

KING HENRY
This battle fares like to the mornings war
When dying clouds contend with growing light
What time the shepherd blowing of his nails
Can neither call it perfect day nor night
Now sways it this way like a mighty sea
Forced by the tide to combat with the wind
Now sways it that way like the selfsame sea
Forced to retire by fury of the wind
Sometime the flood prevails and then the wind
Now one the better then another best
Both tugging to be victors breast to breast
Yet neither conqueror nor conquered
So is the equal poise of this fell war
Here on this molehill will I sit me down
To whom God will there be the victory
For Margaret my queen and Clifford too
Have chid me from the battle swearing both
They prosper best of all when I am thence
Would I were dead if Gods good will were so
For what is in this world but grief and woe
O God Methinks it were a happy life
To be no better than a homely swain
To sit upon a hill as I do now
To carve out dials quaintly point by point
Thereby to see the minutes how they run
How many make the hour full complete
How many hours brings about the day
How many days will finish up the year
How many years a mortal man may live
When this is known then to divide the times
So many hours must I tend my flock
So many hours must I take my rest
So many hours must I contemplate
So many hours must I sport myself
So many days my ewes have been with young
So many weeks ere the poor fools will ean
So many years ere I shall shear the fleece
So minutes hours days months and years
Passed over to the end they were created
Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave
Ah what a life were this How sweet how lovely
Gives not the hawthorn bush a sweeter shade
To shepherds looking on their silly sheep
Than doth a rich embroidered canopy
To kings that fear their subjects treachery
O yes it doth a thousandfold it doth
And to conclude the shepherds homely curds
His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle
His wonted sleep under a fresh trees shade
All which secure and sweetly he enjoys
Is far beyond a princes delicates
His viands sparkling in a golden cup
His body couched in a curious bed
When care mistrust and treason waits on him

Alarum Enter a Son that hath killed his father bringing in the dead
body

SON
Ill blows the wind that profits nobody
This man whom hand to hand I slew in fight
May be possessed with some store of crowns
And I that haply take them from him now
May yet ere night yield both my life and them
To some man else as this dead man doth me
Whos this O God It is my fathers face
Whom in this conflict I unwares have killed
O heavy times begetting such events
From London by the King was I pressed forth
My father being the Earl of Warwicks man
Came on the part of York pressed by his master
And I who at his hands received my life
Have by my hands of life bereaved him
Pardon me God I knew not what I did
And pardon father for I knew not thee
My tears shall wipe away these bloody marks
And no more words till they have flowed their fill

KING HENRY
O piteous spectacle O bloody times
Whiles lions war and battle for their dens
Poor harmless lambs abide their enmity
Weep wretched man Ill aid thee tear for tear
And let our hearts and eyes like civil war
Be blind with tears and break oercharged with grief

Enter a Father who has killed his son with the body in his arms

FATHER
Thou that so stoutly hath resisted me
Give me thy gold if thou hast any gold
For I have bought it with an hundred blows
But let me see is this our foemans face
Ah no no no it is mine only son
Ah boy if any life be left in thee
Throw up thine eye See see what showers arise
Blown with the windy tempest of my heart
Upon thy wounds that kill mine eye and heart
O pity God this miserable age
What stratagems how fell how butcherly
Erroneous mutinous and unnatural
This deadly quarrel daily doth beget
O boy thy father gave thee life too soon
And hath bereft thee of thy life too late

KING HENRY
Woe above woe grief more than common grief
O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds
O pity pity gentle heaven pity
The red rose and the white are on his face
The fatal colours of our striving houses
The one his purple blood right well resembles
The other his pale cheeks methinks presenteth
Wither one rose and let the other flourish
If you contend a thousand lives must wither

SON
How will my mother for a fathers death
Take on with me and neer be satisfied

FATHER
How will my wife for slaughter of my son
Shed seas of tears and neer be satisfied

KING HENRY
How will the country for these woeful chances
Misthink the King and not be satisfied

SON
Was ever son so rued a fathers death

FATHER
Was ever father so bemoaned his son

KING HENRY
Was ever king so grieved for subjects woe
Much is your sorrow mine ten times so much

SON
Ill bear thee hence where I may weep my fill

Exit with the body

FATHER
These arms of mine shall be thy windingsheet
My heart sweet boy shall be thy sepulchre
For from my heart thine image neer shall go
My sighing breast shall be thy funeral bell
And so obsequious will thy father be
Even for the loss of thee having no more
As Priam was for all his valiant sons
Ill bear thee hence and let them fight that will
For I have murdered where I should not kill

Exit with the body

KING HENRY
Sadhearted men much overgone with care
Here sits a king more woeful than you are

Alarums Excursions Enter Queen Margaret Prince of Wales and Exeter

PRINCE EDWARD
Fly father fly for all your friends are fled
And Warwick rages like a chafed bull
Away for death doth hold us in pursuit

QUEEN MARGARET
Mount you my lord towards Berwick post amain
Edward and Richard like a brace of greyhounds
Having the fearful flying hare in sight
With fiery eyes sparkling for very wrath
And bloody steel grasped in their ireful hands
Are at our backs and therefore hence amain

EXETER
Away for vengeance comes along with them
Nay stay not to expostulate make speed
Or else come after Ill away before

KING HENRY
Nay take me with thee good sweet Exeter
Not that I fear to stay but love to go
Whither the Queen intends Forward away

Exeunt

SCENE VI Another Part of the Field

A loud alarum Enter Clifford wounded

CLIFFORD
Here burns my candle out ay here it dies
Which whiles it lasted gave King Henry light
O Lancaster I fear thy overthrow
More than my bodys parting with my soul
My love and fear glued many friends to thee
And now I fall thy tough commixtures melts
Impairing Henry strengthening misproud York
The common people swarm like summer flies
And whither fly the gnats but to the sun
And who shines now but Henrys enemies
O Phoebus hadst thou never given consent
That Phathon should check thy fiery steeds
Thy burning car never had scorched the earth
And Henry hadst thou swayed as kings should do
Or as thy father and his father did
Giving no ground unto the house of York
They never then had sprung like summer flies
I and ten thousand in this luckless realm
Had left no mourning widows for our death
And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace
For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air
And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity
Bootless are plaints and cureless are my wounds
No way to fly nor strength to hold out flight
The foe is merciless and will not pity
For at their hands I have deserved no pity
The air hath got into my deadly wounds
And much effuse of blood doth make me faint
Come York and Richard Warwick and the rest
I stabbed your fathers bosoms split my breast

He faints

Alarum and retreat Enter Edward George Richard Montague Warwick
and Soldiers

EDWARD
Now breathe we lords Good fortune bids us pause
And smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks
Some troops pursue the bloodyminded Queen
That led calm Henry though he were a king
As doth a sail filled with a fretting gust
Command an argosy to stem the waves
But think you lords that Clifford fled with them

WARWICK
No tis impossible he should escape
For though before his face I speak the words
Your brother Richard marked him for the grave
And wheresoer he is hes surely dead

Clifford groans and dies

RICHARD
Whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave
A deadly groan like life and deaths departing

EDWARD
See who it is and now the battles ended
If friend or foe let him be gently used

RICHARD
Revoke that doom of mercy for tis Clifford
Who not contented that he lopped the branch
In hewing Rutland when his leaves put forth
But set his murdering knife unto the root
From whence that tender spray did sweetly spring
I mean our princely father Duke of York

WARWICK
From off the gates of York fetch down the head
Your fathers head which Clifford placed there
Instead whereof let this supply the room
Measure for measure must be answered

EDWARD
Bring forth that fatal screechowl to our house
That nothing sung but death to us and ours
Now death shall stop his dismal threatening sound
And his illboding tongue no more shall speak

Soldiers bring the body forward

WARWICK
I think his understanding is bereft
Speak Clifford dost thou know who speaks to thee
Dark cloudy death oershades his beams of life
And he nor sees nor hears us what we say

RICHARD
O would he did and so perhaps he doth
Tis but his policy to counterfeit
Because he would avoid such bitter taunts
Which in the time of death he gave our father

GEORGE
If so thou thinkst vex him with eager words

RICHARD
Clifford ask mercy and obtain no grace

EDWARD
Clifford repent in bootless penitence

WARWICK
Clifford devise excuses for thy faults

GEORGE
While we devise fell tortures for thy faults

RICHARD
Thou didst love York and I am son to York

EDWARD
Thou pitiedst Rutland I will pity thee

GEORGE
Wheres Captain Margaret to fence you now

WARWICK
They mock thee Clifford swear as thou wast wont

RICHARD
What not an oath Nay then the world goes hard
When Clifford cannot spare his friends an oath
I know by that hes dead and by my soul
If this right hand would buy but two hours life
That I in all despite might rail at him
This hand should chop it off and with the issuing blood
Stifle the villain whose unstaunched thirst
York and young Rutland could not satisfy

WARWICK
Ay but hes dead Off with the traitors head
And rear it in the place your fathers stands
And now to London with triumphant march
There to be crowned Englands royal king
From whence shall Warwick cut the sea to France
And ask the Lady Bona for thy queen
So shalt thou sinew both these lands together
And having France thy friend thou shalt not dread
The scattered foe that hopes to rise again
For though they cannot greatly sting to hurt
Yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears
First will I see the coronation
And then to Brittany Ill cross the sea
To effect this marriage so it please my lord

EDWARD
Even as thou wilt sweet Warwick let it be
For in thy shoulder do I build my seat
And never will I undertake the thing
Wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting
Richard I will create thee Duke of Gloucester
And George of Clarence Warwick as ourself
Shall do and undo as him pleaseth best

RICHARD
Let me be Duke of Clarence George of Gloucester
For Gloucesters dukedom is too ominous

WARWICK
Tut thats a foolish observation
Richard be Duke of Gloucester Now to London
To see these honours in possession

Exeunt




ACT III

SCENE I A Forest in the North of England


Enter two Keepers with crossbows in their hands

1 KEEPER
Under this thickgrown brake well shroud ourselves
For through this laund anon the deer will come
And in this covert will we make our stand
Culling the principal of all the deer

2 KEEPER
Ill stay above the hill so both may shoot

1 KEEPER
That cannot be the noise of thy crossbow
Will scare the herd and so my shoot is lost
Here stand we both and aim we at the best
And for the time shall not seem tedious
Ill tell thee what befell me on a day
In this self place where now we mean to stand

2 KEEPER
Here comes a man lets stay till he be past

Enter King Henry disguised with a prayerbook

KING HENRY
From Scotland am I stolen even of pure love
To greet mine own land with my wishful sight
No Harry Harry tis no land of thine
Thy place is filled thy sceptre wrung from thee
Thy balm washed off wherewith thou wast anointed
No bending knee will call thee Caesar now
No humble suitors press to speak for right
No not a man comes for redress of thee
For how can I help them and not myself

1 KEEPER
Ay heres a deer whose skins a keepers fee
This is the quondam king lets seize upon him

KING HENRY
Let me embrace thee sour adversity
For wise men say it is the wisest course

2 KEEPER
Why linger we Let us lay hands upon him

1 KEEPER
Forbear awhile well hear a little more

KING HENRY
My queen and son are gone to France for aid
And as I hear the great commanding Warwick
Is thither gone to crave the French Kings sister
To wife for Edward If this news be true
Poor queen and son your labour is but lost
For Warwick is a subtle orator
And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words
By this account then Margaret may win him
For shes a woman to be pitied much
Her sighs will make a battry in his breast
Her tears will pierce into a marble heart
The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn
And Nero will be tainted with remorse
To hear and see her plaints her brinish tears
Ay but shes come to beg Warwick to give
She on his left side craving aid for Henry
He on his right asking a wife for Edward
She weeps and says her Henry is deposed
He smiles and says his Edward is installed
That she poor wretch for grief can speak no more
Whiles Warwick tells his title smooths the wrong
Inferreth arguments of mighty strength
And in conclusion wins the King from her
With promise of his sister and what else
To strengthen and support King Edwards place
O Margaret thus twill be and thou poor soul
Art then forsaken as thou wentst forlorn

2 KEEPER
Say what art thou that talkst of kings and queens

KING HENRY
More than I seem and less than I was born to
A man at least for less I should not be
And men may talk of kings and why not I

2 KEEPER
Ay but thou talkst as if thou wert a king

KING HENRY
Why so I am in mind and thats enough

2 KEEPER
But if thou be a king where is thy crown

KING HENRY
My crown is in my heart not on my head
Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones
Not to be seen My crown is called content
A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy

2 KEEPER
Well if you be a king crowned with content
Your crown content and you must be contented
To go along with us for as we think
You are the king King Edward hath deposed
And we his subjects sworn in all allegiance
Will apprehend you as his enemy

KING HENRY
But did you never swear and break an oath

2 KEEPER
No never such an oath nor will not now

KING HENRY
Where did you dwell when I was King of England

2 KEEPER
Here in this country where we now remain

KING HENRY
I was anointed king at nine months old
My father and my grandfather were kings
And you were sworn true subjects unto me
And tell me then have you not broke your oaths

1 KEEPER
No for we were subjects but while you were king

KING HENRY
Why am I dead Do I not breathe a man
Ah simple men you know not what you swear
Look as I blow this feather from my face
And as the air blows it to me again
Obeying with my wind when I do blow
And yielding to another when it blows
Commanded always by the greater gust
Such is the lightness of you common men
But do not break your oaths for of that sin
My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty
Go where you will the King shall be commanded
And be you kings command and Ill obey

1 KEEPER
We are true subjects to the King King Edward

KING HENRY
So would you be again to Henry
If he were seated as King Edward is

1 KEEPER
We charge you in Gods name and the Kings
To go with us unto the officers

KING HENRY
In Gods name lead your kings name be obeyed
And what God will that let your king perform
And what he will I humbly yield unto

Exeunt

SCENE II The Palace

Enter King Edward Richard Duke of Gloucester George Duke of
Clarence and Lady Grey

KING EDWARD
Brother of Gloucester at Saint Albans field
This ladys husband Sir John Grey was slain
His land then seized on by the conqueror
Her suit is now to repossess those lands
Which we in justice cannot well deny
Because in quarrel of the house of York
The worthy gentleman did lose his life

RICHARD
Your Highness shall do well to grant her suit
It were dishonour to deny it her

KING EDWARD
It were no less but yet Ill make a pause

Before the King will grant her humble suit

KING EDWARD

LADY GREY

KING EDWARD

RICHARD
Aside to George Ay good leave have you for you will have leave
Till youth take leave and leave you to the crutch

Richard and George stand aside

KING EDWARD
Now tell me madam do you love your children

LADY GREY
Ay full as dearly as I love myself

KING EDWARD
And would you not do much to do them good

LADY GREY
To do them good I would sustain some harm

KING EDWARD
Then get your husbands lands to do them good

LADY GREY
Therefore I came unto your majesty

KING EDWARD
Ill tell you how these lands are to be got

LADY GREY
So shall you bind me to your Highness service

KING EDWARD
What service wilt thou do me if I give them

LADY GREY
What you command that rests in me to do

KING EDWARD
But you will take exceptions to my boon

LADY GREY
No gracious lord except I cannot do it

KING EDWARD
Ay but thou canst do what I mean to ask

LADY GREY
Why then I will do what your Grace commands

RICHARD
Aside to George He plies her hard and much rain wears the marble

GEORGE
Aside to Richard As red as fire Nay then her wax must melt

LADY GREY
Why stops my lord Shall I not hear my task

KING EDWARD
An easy task tis but to love a king

LADY GREY
Thats soon performed because I am a subject

KING EDWARD
Why then thy husbands lands I freely give thee

LADY GREY
I take my leave with many thousand thanks

RICHARD
Aside to George The match is made she seals it with a curtsy

KING EDWARD
But stay thee tis the fruits of love I mean

LADY GREY
The fruits of love I mean my loving liege

KING EDWARD
Ay but I fear me in another sense
What love thinkst thou I sue so much to get

LADY GREY
My love till death my humble thanks my prayers
That love which virtue begs and virtue grants

KING EDWARD
No by my troth I did not mean such love

LADY GREY
Why then you mean not as I thought you did

KING EDWARD
But now you partly may perceive my mind

LADY GREY
My mind will never grant what I perceive
Your Highness aims at if I aim aright

KING EDWARD
To tell thee plain I aim to lie with thee

LADY GREY
To tell you plain I had rather lie in prison

KING EDWARD
Why then thou shalt not have thy husbands lands

LADY GREY
Why then mine honesty shall be my dower
For by that loss I will not purchase them

KING EDWARD
Therein thou wrongst thy children mightily

LADY GREY
Herein your Highness wrongs both them and me
But mighty lord this merry inclination
Accords not with the sadness of my suit
Please you dismiss me either with ay or no

KING EDWARD
Ay if thou wilt say ay to my request
No if thou dost say no to my demand

LADY GREY
Then no my lord My suit is at an end

RICHARD
Aside to George The widow likes him not she knits her brows

GEORGE
Aside to Richard He is the bluntest wooer in Christendom

KING EDWARD
Aside Her looks doth argue her replete with modesty
Her words doth show her wit incomparable
All her perfections challenge sovereignty
One way or other she is for a king
And she shall be my love or else my queen
Say that King Edward take thee for his queen

LADY GREY
Tis better said than done my gracious lord
I am a subject fit to jest withal
But far unfit to be a sovereign

KING EDWARD
Sweet widow by my state I swear to thee
I speak no more than what my soul intends
And that is to enjoy thee for my love

LADY GREY
And that is more than I will yield unto
I know I am too mean to be your queen
And yet too good to be your concubine

KING EDWARD
You cavil widow I did mean my queen

LADY GREY
Twill grieve your Grace my sons should call you father

KING EDWARD
No more than when my daughters call thee mother
Thou art a widow and thou hast some children
And by Gods mother I being but a bachelor
Have other some Why tis a happy thing
To be the father unto many sons
Answer no more for thou shalt be my queen

RICHARD
Aside to George The ghostly father now hath done his shrift

GEORGE
Aside to Richard When he was made a shriver twas for shift

KING EDWARD
Brothers you muse what chat we two have had

Richard and George come forward

RICHARD
The widow likes it not for she looks very sad

KING EDWARD
Youd think it strange if I should marry her

GEORGE
To whom my lord

KING EDWARD
Why Clarence to myself

RICHARD
That would be ten days wonder at the least

GEORGE
Thats a day longer than a wonder lasts

RICHARD
By so much is the wonder in extremes

KING EDWARD
Well jest on brothers I can tell you both
Her suit is granted for her husbands lands

Enter a Nobleman

NOBLEMAN
My gracious lord Henry your foe is taken
And brought your prisoner to your palace gate

KING EDWARD
See that he be conveyed unto the Tower
And go we brothers to the man that took him
To question of his apprehension
Widow go you along Lords use her honourably

Exeunt all but Richard

RICHARD
Ay Edward will use women honourably
Would he were wasted marrow bones and all
That from his loins no hopeful branch may spring
To cross me from the golden time I look for
And yet between my souls desire and me
The lustful Edwards title buried
Is Clarence Henry and his son young Edward
And all the unlookedfor issue of their bodies
To take their rooms ere I can place myself
A cold premeditation for my purpose
Why then I do but dream on sovereignty
Like one that stands upon a promontory
And spies a faroff shore where he would tread
Wishing his foot were equal with his eye
And chides the sea that sunders him from thence
Saying hell lade it dry to have his way
So do I wish the crown being so far off
And so I chide the means that keeps me from it
And so I say Ill cut the causes off
Flattering me with impossibilities
My eyes too quick my heart oerweens too much
Unless my hand and strength could equal them
Well say there is no kingdom then for Richard
What other pleasure can the world afford
Ill make my heaven in a ladys lap
And deck my body in gay ornaments
And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks
O miserable thought and more unlikely
Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns
Why Love forswore me in my mothers womb
And for I should not deal in her soft laws
She did corrupt frail Nature with some bribe
To shrink mine arm up like a withered shrub
To make an envious mountain on my back
Where sits Deformity to mock my body
To shape my legs of an unequal size
To disproportion me in every part
Like to a chaos or an unlicked bearwhelp
That carries no impression like the dam
And am I then a man to be beloved
O monstrous fault to harbour such a thought
Then since this earth affords no joy to me
But to command to check to oerbear such
As are of better person than myself
Ill make my heaven to dream upon the crown
And whiles I live t account this world but hell
Until my misshaped trunk that bear this head
Be round impaled with a glorious crown
And yet I know not how to get the crown
For many lives stand between me and home
And I like one lost in a thorny wood
That rents the thorns and is rent with the thorns
Seeking a way and straying from the way
Not knowing how to find the open air
But toiling desperately to find it out
Torment myself to catch the English crown
And from that torment I will free myself
Or hew my way out with a bloody axe
Why I can smile and murder while I smile
And cry Content to that which grieves my heart
And wet my cheeks with artificial tears
And frame my face to all occasions
Ill drown more sailors than the mermaid shall
Ill slay more gazers than the basilisk
Ill play the orator as well as Nestor
Deceive more slyly than Ulysses could
And like a Sinon take another Troy
I can add colours to the chameleon
Change shapes with Proteus for advantages
And set the murderous Machiavel to school
Can I do this and cannot get a crown
Tut were it farther off Ill pluck it down

Exit

SCENE III France The Kings Palace

Flourish Enter Lewis the French King his sister the Lady Bona his
Admiral called Bourbon Prince Edward Queen Margaret and the Earl of
Oxford Lewis sits and riseth up again

KING LEWIS
Fair Queen of England worthy Margaret
Sit down with us It ill befits thy state
And birth that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit

QUEEN MARGARET
No mighty King of France Now Margaret
Must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve
Where kings command I was I must confess
Great Albions queen in former golden days
But now mischance hath trod my title down
And with dishonour laid me on the ground
Where I must take like seat unto my fortune
And to my humble seat conform myself

KING LEWIS
Why say fair queen whence springs this deep despair

QUEEN MARGARET
From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears
And stops my tongue while heart is drowned in cares

KING LEWIS
Whateer it be be thou still like thyself
And sit thee by our side Yield not thy neck

Seats her by him

To Fortunes yoke but let thy dauntless mind
Still ride in triumph over all mischance
Be plain Queen Margaret and tell thy grief
It shall be eased if France can yield relief

QUEEN MARGARET
Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts
And give my tonguetied sorrows leave to speak
Now therefore be it known to noble Lewis
That Henry sole possessor of my love
Is of a king become a banished man
And forced to live in Scotland a forlorn
While proud ambitious Edward Duke of York
Usurps the regal title and the seat
Of Englands trueanointed lawful king
This is the cause that I poor Margaret
With this my son Prince Edward Henrys heir
Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid
And if thou fail us all our hope is done
Scotland hath will to help but cannot help
Our people and our peers are both misled
Our treasure seized our soldiers put to flight
And as thou seest ourselves in heavy plight

KING LEWIS
Renowned queen with patience calm the storm
While we bethink a means to break it off

QUEEN MARGARET
The more we stay the stronger grows our foe

KING LEWIS
The more I stay the more Ill succour thee

QUEEN MARGARET
O but impatience waiteth on true sorrow
And see where comes the breeder of my sorrow

Enter Warwick

KING LEWIS
Whats he approacheth boldly to our presence

QUEEN MARGARET
Our Earl of Warwick Edwards greatest friend

KING LEWIS
Welcome brave Warwick What brings thee to France

He descends Queen Margaret rises

QUEEN MARGARET
Ay now begins a second storm to rise
For this is he that moves both wind and tide

WARWICK
From worthy Edward king of Albion
My lord and sovereign and thy vowed friend
I come in kindness and unfeigned love
First to do greetings to thy royal person
And then to crave a league of amity
And lastly to confirm that amity
With nuptial knot if thou vouchsafe to grant
That virtuous Lady Bona thy fair sister
To Englands king in lawful marriage

QUEEN MARGARET
Aside If that go forward Henrys hope is done

WARWICK
To Bona And gracious madam in our kings behalf
I am commanded with your leave and favour
Humbly to kiss your hand and with my tongue
To tell the passion of my sovereigns heart
Where fame late entering at his heedful ears
Hath placed thy beautys image and thy virtue

QUEEN MARGARET
King Lewis and Lady Bona hear me speak
Before you answer Warwick His demand
Springs not from Edwards wellmeant honest love
But from deceit bred by necessity
For how can tyrants safely govern home
Unless abroad they purchase great alliance
To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice
That Henry liveth still but were he dead
Yet here Prince Edward stands King Henrys son
Look therefore Lewis that by this league and marriage
Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour
For though usurpers sway the rule awhile
Yet heavens are just and time suppresseth wrongs

WARWICK
Injurious Margaret

PRINCE EDWARD
And why not Queen

WARWICK
Because thy father Henry did usurp
And thou no more art prince than she is queen

OXFORD
Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt
Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain
And after John of Gaunt Henry the Fourth
Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest
And after that wise prince Henry the Fifth
Who by his prowess conquered all France
From these our Henry lineally descends

WARWICK
Oxford how haps it in this smooth discourse
You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost
All that which Henry the Fifth had gotten
Methinks these peers of France should smile at that
But for the rest you tell a pedigree
Of threescore and two years a silly time
To make prescription for a kingdoms worth

OXFORD
Why Warwick canst thou speak against thy liege
Whom thou obeyedst thirty and six years
And not bewray thy treason with a blush

WARWICK
Can Oxford that did ever fence the right
Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree
For shame Leave Henry and call Edward king

OXFORD
Call him my king by whose injurious doom
My elder brother the Lord Aubrey Vere
Was done to death And more than so my father
Even in the downfall of his mellowed years
When nature brought him to the door of death
No Warwick no while life upholds this arm
This arm upholds the house of Lancaster

WARWICK
And I the house of York

KING LEWIS
Queen Margaret Prince Edward and Oxford
Vouchsafe at our request to stand aside
While I use further conference with Warwick

They stand aloof

QUEEN MARGARET
Heavens grant that Warwicks words bewitch him not

KING LEWIS
Now Warwick tell me even upon thy conscience
Is Edward your true king For I were loath
To link with him that were not lawful chosen

WARWICK
Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour

KING LEWIS
But is he gracious in the peoples eye

WARWICK
The more that Henry was unfortunate

KING LEWIS
Then further all dissembling set aside
Tell me for truth the measure of his love
Unto our sister Bona

WARWICK
Such it seems
As may beseem a monarch like himself
Myself have often heard him say and swear
That this his love was an eternal plant
Whereof the root was fixed in virtues ground
The leaves and fruit maintained with beautys sun
Exempt from envy but not from disdain
Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain

KING LEWIS
Now sister let us hear your firm resolve

BONA
Your grant or your denial shall be mine
To Warwick Yet I confess that often ere this day
When I have heard your kings desert recounted
Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire

KING LEWIS
Then Warwick thus our sister shall be Edwards
And now forthwith shall articles be drawn
Touching the jointure that your king must make
Which with her dowry shall be counterpoised
Draw near Queen Margaret and be a witness
That Bona shall be wife to the English king

PRINCE EDWARD
To Edward but not to the English king

QUEEN MARGARET
Deceitful Warwick it was thy device
By this alliance to make void my suit
Before thy coming Lewis was Henrys friend

KING LEWIS
And still is friend to him and Margaret
But if your title to the crown be weak
As may appear by Edwards good success
Then tis but reason that I be released
From giving aid which late I promised
Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand
That your estate requires and mine can yield

WARWICK
Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease
Where having nothing nothing can he lose
And as for you yourself our quondam queen
You have a father able to maintain you
And better twere you troubled him than France

QUEEN MARGARET
Peace impudent and shameless Warwick
Proud setter up and puller down of kings
I will not hence till with my talk and tears
Both full of truth I make King Lewis behold
Thy sly conveyance and thy lords false love
For both of you are birds of selfsame feather

Post blowing a horn within

KING LEWIS
Warwick this is some post to us or thee

Enter the Post

POST
My lord ambassador these letters are for you
Sent from your brother Marquess Montague
These from our king unto your Majesty
And madam these for you from whom I know not

They all read their letters

OXFORD
I like it well that our fair Queen and mistress
Smiles at her news while Warwick frowns at his

PRINCE EDWARD
Nay mark how Lewis stamps as he were nettled
I hope alls for the best

KING LEWIS
Warwick what are thy news And yours fair Queen

QUEEN MARGARET
Mine such as fill my heart with unhoped joys

WARWICK
Mine full of sorrow and hearts discontent

KING LEWIS
What has your king married the Lady Grey
And now to soothe your forgery and his
Sends me a paper to persuade me patience
Is this th alliance that he seeks with France
Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner

QUEEN MARGARET
I told your majesty as much before
This proveth Edwards love and Warwicks honesty

WARWICK
King Lewis I here protest in sight of heaven
And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss
That I am clear from this misdeed of Edwards
No more my king for he dishonours me
But most himself if he could see his shame
Did I forget that by the house of York
My father came untimely to his death
Did I let pass th abuse done to my niece
Did I impale him with the regal crown
Did I put Henry from his native right
And am I guerdoned at the last with shame
Shame on himself for my desert is honour
And to repair my honour lost for him
I here renounce him and return to Henry
My noble Queen let former grudges pass
And henceforth I am thy true servitor
I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona
And replant Henry in his former state

QUEEN MARGARET
Warwick these words have turned my hate to love
And I forgive and quite forget old faults
And joy that thou becomst King Henrys friend

WARWICK
So much his friend ay his unfeigned friend
That if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us
With some few bands of chosen soldiers
Ill undertake to land them on our coast
And force the tyrant from his seat by war
Tis not his newmade bride shall succour him
And as for Clarence as my letters tell me
Hes very likely now to fall from him
For matching more for wanton lust than honour
Or than for strength and safety of our country

BONA
Dear brother how shall Bona be revenged
But by thy help to this distressed queen

QUEEN MARGARET
Renowned prince how shall poor Henry live
Unless thou rescue him from foul despair

BONA
My quarrel and this English queens are one

WARWICK
And mine fair Lady Bona joins with yours

KING LEWIS
And mine with hers and thine and Margarets
Therefore at last I firmly am resolved
You shall have aid

QUEEN MARGARET
Let me give humble thanks for all at once

KING LEWIS
Then Englands messenger return in post
And tell false Edward thy supposed king
That Lewis of France is sending over maskers
To revel it with him and his new bride
Thou seest whats past go fear thy king withal

BONA
Tell him in hope hell prove a widower shortly
Ill wear the willow garland for his sake

QUEEN MARGARET
Tell him my mourning weeds are laid aside
And I am ready to put armour on

WARWICK
Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong
And therefore Ill uncrown him ere t be long
Theres thy reward be gone

Exit Post

KING LEWIS
But Warwick
Thou and Oxford with five thousand men
Shall cross the seas and bid false Edward battle
And as occasion serves this noble Queen
And prince shall follow with a fresh supply
Yet ere thou go but answer me one doubt
What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty

WARWICK
This shall assure my constant loyalty
That if our Queen and this young prince agree
Ill join mine eldest daughter and my joy
To him forthwith in holy wedlock bands

QUEEN MARGARET
Yes I agree and thank you for your motion
Son Edward she is fair and virtuous
Therefore delay not give thy hand to Warwick
And with thy hand thy faith irrevocable
That only Warwicks daughter shall be thine

PRINCE EDWARD
Yes I accept her for she well deserves it
And here to pledge my vow I give my hand

He gives his hand to Warwick

KING LEWIS
Why stay we now These soldiers shall be levied
And thou Lord Bourbon our High Admiral
Shall waft them over with our royal fleet
I long till Edward fall by wars mischance
For mocking marriage with a dame of France

Exeunt all but Warwick

WARWICK
I came from Edward as ambassador
But I return his sworn and mortal foe
Matter of marriage was the charge he gave me
But dreadful war shall answer his demand
Had he none else to make a stale but me
Then none but I shall turn his jest to sorrow
I was the chief that raised him to the crown
And Ill be chief to bring him down again
Not that I pity Henrys misery
But seek revenge on Edwards mockery

Exit




ACT IV

SCENE I London The Palace


Enter Richard Duke of Gloucester George Duke of Clarence Somerset
and Montague

RICHARD
Now tell me brother Clarence what think you
Of this new marriage with the Lady Grey
Hath not our brother made a worthy choice

GEORGE
Alas you know tis far from hence to France
How could he stay till Warwick made return

SOMERSET
My lords forbear this talk here comes the King

Flourish Enter King Edward attended Lady Grey as Queen Elizabeth
Pembroke Stafford Hastings and others Four stand on one side and
four on the other

RICHARD
And his wellchosen bride

GEORGE
I mind to tell him plainly what I think

KING EDWARD
Now brother of Clarence how like you our choice
That you stand pensive as half malcontent

GEORGE
As well as Lewis of France or the Earl of Warwick
Which are so weak of courage and in judgment
That theyll take no offence at our abuse

KING EDWARD
Suppose they take offence without a cause
They are but Lewis and Warwick I am Edward
Your King and Warwicks and must have my will

RICHARD
And shall have your will because our King
Yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well

KING EDWARD
Yea brother Richard are you offended too

RICHARD
Not I
No God forbid that I should wish them severed
Whom God hath joined together Ay and twere pity
To sunder them that yoke so well together

KING EDWARD
Setting your scorns and your mislike aside
Tell me some reason why the Lady Grey
Should not become my wife and Englands queen
And you too Somerset and Montague
Speak freely what you think

GEORGE
Then this is mine opinion that King Lewis
Becomes your enemy for mocking him
About the marriage of the Lady Bona

RICHARD
And Warwick doing what you gave in charge
Is now dishonoured by this new marriage

KING EDWARD
What if both Lewis and Warwick be appeased
By such invention as I can devise

MONTAGUE
Yet to have joined with France in such alliance
Would more have strengthened this our commonwealth
Gainst foreign storms than any homebred marriage

HASTINGS
Why knows not Montague that of itself
England is safe if true within itself

MONTAGUE
But the safer when tis backed with France

HASTINGS
Tis better using France than trusting France
Let us be backed with God and with the seas
Which He hath givn for fence impregnable
And with their helps only defend ourselves
In them and in ourselves our safety lies

GEORGE
For this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves
To have the heir of the Lord Hungerford

KING EDWARD
Ay what of that It was my will and grant
And for this once my will shall stand for law

RICHARD
And yet methinks your Grace hath not done well
To give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales
Unto the brother of your loving bride
She better would have fitted me or Clarence
But in your bride you bury brotherhood

GEORGE
Or else you would not have bestowed the heir
Of the Lord Bonville on your new wifes son
And leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere

KING EDWARD
Alas poor Clarence is it for a wife
That thou art malcontent I will provide thee

GEORGE
In choosing for yourself you showed your judgment
Which being shallow you shall give me leave
To play the broker in mine own behalf
And to that end I shortly mind to leave you

KING EDWARD
Leave me or tarry Edward will be king
And not be tied unto his brothers will

QUEEN ELIZABETH
My lords before it pleased his Majesty
To raise my state to title of a queen
Do me but right and you must all confess
That I was not ignoble of descent
And meaner than myself have had like fortune
But as this title honours me and mine
So your dislikes to whom I would be pleasing
Doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow

KING EDWARD
My love forbear to fawn upon their frowns
What danger or what sorrow can befall thee
So long as Edward is thy constant friend
And their true sovereign whom they must obey
Nay whom they shall obey and love thee too
Unless they seek for hatred at my hands
Which if they do yet will I keep thee safe
And they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath

RICHARD
Aside I hear yet say not much but think the more

Enter a Post

KING EDWARD
Now messenger what letters or what news
From France

POST
My sovereign liege no letters and few words
But such as I without your special pardon
Dare not relate

KING EDWARD
Go to we pardon thee Therefore in brief
Tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them
What answer makes King Lewis unto our letters

POST
At my depart these were his very words
Go tell false Edward thy supposed king
That Lewis of France is sending over maskers
To revel it with him and his new bride

KING EDWARD
Is Lewis so brave Belike he thinks me Henry
But what said Lady Bona to my marriage

POST
These were her words uttered with mild disdain
Tell him in hope hell prove a widower shortly
Ill wear the willow garland for his sake

KING EDWARD
I blame not her she could say little less
She had the wrong But what said Henrys queen
For I have heard that she was there in place

POST
Tell him quoth she my mourning weeds are done
And I am ready to put armour on

KING EDWARD
Belike she minds to play the Amazon
But what said Warwick to these injuries

POST
He more incensed against your Majesty
Than all the rest discharged me with these words
Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong
And therefore Ill uncrown him ere t be long

KING EDWARD
Ha Durst the traitor breathe out so proud words
Well I will arm me being thus forewarned
They shall have wars and pay for their presumption
But say is Warwick friends with Margaret

POST
Ay gracious sovereign they are so linked in friendship
That young Prince Edward marries Warwicks daughter

GEORGE
Belike the elder Clarence will have the younger
Now brother king farewell and sit you fast
For I will hence to Warwicks other daughter
That though I want a kingdom yet in marriage
I may not prove inferior to yourself
You that love me and Warwick follow me

Exit George and Somerset follows

RICHARD
Aside Not I My thoughts aim at a further matter
I stay not for the love of Edward but the crown

KING EDWARD
Clarence and Somerset both gone to Warwick
Yet am I armed against the worst can happen
And haste is needful in this desperate case
Pembroke and Stafford you in our behalf
Go levy men and make prepare for war
They are already or quickly will be landed
Myself in person will straight follow you

Exeunt Pembroke and Stafford

But ere I go Hastings and Montague
Resolve my doubt You twain of all the rest
Are near to Warwick by blood and by alliance
Tell me if you love Warwick more than me
If it be so then both depart to him
I rather wish you foes than hollow friends
But if you mind to hold your true obedience
Give me assurance with some friendly vow
That I may never have you in suspect

MONTAGUE
So God help Montague as he proves true

HASTINGS
And Hastings as he favours Edwards cause

KING EDWARD
Now brother Richard will you stand by us

RICHARD
Ay in despite of all that shall withstand you

KING EDWARD
Why so Then am I sure of victory
Now therefore let us hence and lose no hour
Till we meet Warwick with his foreign power

Exeunt

SCENE II A Plain in Warwickshire

Enter Warwick and Oxford in England with French Soldiers

WARWICK
Trust me my lord all hitherto goes well
The common people by numbers swarm to us

Enter George Duke of Clarence and Somerset

But see where Somerset and Clarence comes
Speak suddenly my lords are we all friends

GEORGE
Fear not that my lord

WARWICK
Then gentle Clarence welcome unto Warwick
And welcome Somerset I hold it cowardice
To rest mistrustful where a noble heart
Hath pawned an open hand in sign of love
Else might I think that Clarence Edwards brother
Were but a feigned friend to our proceedings
But welcome sweet Clarence my daughter shall be thine
And now what rests but in nights coverture
Thy brother being carelessly encamped
His soldiers lurking in the towns about
And but attended by a simple guard
We may surprise and take him at our pleasure
Our scouts have found the adventure very easy
That as Ulysses and stout Diomede
With sleight and manhood stole to Rhesus tents
And brought from thence the Thracian fatal steeds
So we well covered with the nights black mantle
At unawares may beat down Edwards guard
And seize himself I say not slaughter him
For I intend but only to surprise him
You that will follow me to this attempt
Applaud the name of Henry with your leader

They all cry Henry

Why then lets on our way in silent sort
For Warwick and his friends God and Saint George

Exeunt

SCENE III Edwards Camp near Warwick

Enter three Watchmen to guard the Kings tent

1 WATCHMAN
Come on my masters each man take his stand
The King by this is set him down to sleep

2 WATCHMAN
What will he not to bed

1 WATCHMAN
Why no for he hath made a solemn vow
Never to lie and take his natural rest
Till Warwick or himself be quite suppressed

2 WATCHMAN
Tomorrow then belike shall be the day
If Warwick be so near as men report

3 WATCHMAN
But say I pray what nobleman is that
That with the King here resteth in his tent

1 WATCHMAN
Tis the Lord Hastings the Kings chiefest friend

3 WATCHMAN
O is it so But why commands the King
That his chief followers lodge in towns about him
While he himself keeps in the cold field

2 WATCHMAN
Tis the more honour because more dangerous

3 WATCHMAN
Ay but give me worship and quietness
I like it better than dangerous honour
If Warwick knew in what estate he stands
Tis to be doubted he would waken him

1 WATCHMAN
Unless our halberds did shut up his passage

2 WATCHMAN
Ay wherefore else guard we his royal tent
But to defend his person from nightfoes

Enter Warwick George Duke of Clarence Oxford Somerset and French
Soldiers silent all

WARWICK
This is his tent and see where stand his guard
Courage my masters Honour now or never
But follow me and Edward shall be ours

1 WATCHMAN
Who goes there

2 WATCHMAN
Stay or thou diest

Warwick and the rest cry all Warwick Warwick and set upon the
guard who fly crying Arm Arm Warwick and the rest following
them

The drum playing and trumpet sounding enter Warwick Somerset and the
rest bringing the King out in his gown sitting in a chair Richard
Duke of Gloucester and Hastings fly over the stage

SOMERSET
What are they that fly there

WARWICK
Richard and Hastings
Let them go Here is the Duke

KING EDWARD
The Duke Why Warwick when we parted
Thou calldst me king

WARWICK
Ay but the case is altered
When you disgraced me in my embassade
Then I degraded you from being king
And come now to create you Duke of York
Alas how should you govern any kingdom
That know not how to use ambassadors
Nor how to be contented with one wife
Nor how to use your brothers brotherly
Nor how to study for the peoples welfare
Nor how to shroud yourself from enemies

KING EDWARD
Yea brother of Clarence art thou here too
Nay then I see that Edward needs must down
Yet Warwick in despite of all mischance
Of thee thyself and all thy complices
Edward will always bear himself as king
Though Fortunes malice overthrow my state
My mind exceeds the compass of her wheel

WARWICK
Then for his mind be Edward Englands king

Takes off his crown

But Henry now shall wear the English crown
And be true king indeed thou but the shadow
My lord of Somerset at my request
See that forthwith Duke Edward be conveyed
Unto my brother Archbishop of York
When I have fought with Pembroke and his fellows
Ill follow you and tell what answer
Lewis and the Lady Bona send to him
Now for a while farewell good Duke of York

They begin to lead him out forcibly

KING EDWARD
What fates impose that men must needs abide
It boots not to resist both wind and tide

Exit King Edward led out Somerset with him

OXFORD
What now remains my lords for us to do
But march to London with our soldiers

WARWICK
Ay thats the first thing that we have to do
To free King Henry from imprisonment
And see him seated in the regal throne

Exeunt

SCENE IV London The Palace

Enter Queen Elizabeth and Rivers

RIVERS
Madam what makes you in this sudden change

QUEEN ELIZABETH
Why brother Rivers are you yet to learn
What late misfortune is befalln King Edward

RIVERS
What loss of some pitched battle against Warwick

QUEEN ELIZABETH
No but the loss of his own royal person

RIVERS
Then is my sovereign slain

QUEEN ELIZABETH
Ay almost slain for he is taken prisoner
Either betrayed by falsehood of his guard
Or by his foe surprised at unawares
And as I further have to understand
Is new committed to the Bishop of York
Fell Warwicks brother and by that our foe

RIVERS
These news I must confess are full of grief
Yet gracious madam bear it as you may
Warwick may lose that now hath won the day

QUEEN ELIZABETH
Till then fair hope must hinder lifes decay
And I the rather wean me from despair
For love of Edwards offspring in my womb
This is it that makes me bridle passion
And bear with mildness my misfortunes cross
Ay ay for this I draw in many a tear
And stop the rising of bloodsucking sighs
Lest with my sighs or tears I blast or drown
King Edwards fruit true heir to th English crown

RIVERS
But madam where is Warwick then become

QUEEN ELIZABETH
I am informed that he comes towards London
To set the crown once more on Henrys head
Guess thou the rest King Edwards friends must down
But to prevent the tyrants violence
For trust not him that hath once broken faith
Ill hence forthwith unto the sanctuary
To save at least the heir of Edwards right
There shall I rest secure from force and fraud
Come therefore let us fly while we may fly
If Warwick take us we are sure to die

Exeunt

SCENE V A park near Middleham Castle in Yorkshire

Enter Richard Duke of Gloucester Lord Hastings Sir William Stanley
and others

RICHARD
Now my Lord Hastings and Sir William Stanley
Leave off to wonder why I drew you hither
Into this chiefest thicket of the park
Thus stands the case you know our King my brother
Is prisoner to the Bishop here at whose hands
He hath good usage and great liberty
And often but attended with weak guard
Comes hunting this way to disport himself
I have advertised him by secret means
That if about this hour he make this way
Under the colour of his usual game
He shall here find his friends with horse and men
To set him free from his captivity

Enter King Edward and a Huntsman with him

HUNTSMAN
This way my lord for this way lies the game

KING EDWARD
Nay this way man See where the huntsmen stand
Now brother of Gloucester Lord Hastings and the rest
Stand you thus close to steal the Bishops deer

RICHARD
Brother the time and case requireth haste
Your horse stands ready at the park corner

KING EDWARD
But whither shall we then

HASTINGS
To Lynn my lord and shipped from thence to Flanders

RICHARD
Well guessed believe me for that was my meaning

KING EDWARD
Stanley I will requite thy forwardness

RICHARD
But wherefore stay we Tis no time to talk

KING EDWARD
Huntsman what sayst thou Wilt thou go along

HUNTSMAN
Better do so than tarry and be hanged

RICHARD
Come then away Lets ha no more ado

KING EDWARD
Bishop farewell shield thee from Warwicks frown
And pray that I may repossess the crown

Exeunt

SCENE VI London The Tower

Enter King Henry George Duke of Clarence Warwick Somerset young
Richmond Oxford Montague and Lieutenant of the Tower

KING HENRY
Master Lieutenant now that God and friends
Have shaken Edward from the regal seat
And turned my captive state to liberty
My fear to hope my sorrows unto joys
At our enlargement what are thy due fees

LIEUTENANT
Subjects may challenge nothing of their sovereigns
But if an humble prayer may prevail
I then crave pardon of your Majesty

KING HENRY
For what lieutenant For well using me
Nay be thou sure Ill well requite thy kindness
For that it made my imprisonment a pleasure
Ay such a pleasure as incaged birds
Conceive when after many moody thoughts
At last by notes of household harmony
They quite forget their loss of liberty
But Warwick after God thou settst me free
And chiefly therefore I thank God and thee
He was the author thou the instrument
Therefore that I may conquer Fortunes spite
By living low where Fortune cannot hurt me
And that the people of this blessed land
May not be punished with my thwarting stars
Warwick although my head still wear the crown
I here resign my government to thee
For thou art fortunate in all thy deeds

WARWICK
Your Grace hath still been famed for virtuous
And now may seem as wise as virtuous
By spying and avoiding Fortunes malice
For few men rightly temper with the stars
Yet in this one thing let me blame your Grace
For choosing me when Clarence is in place

GEORGE
No Warwick thou art worthy of the sway
To whom the heavens in thy nativity
Adjudged an olive branch and laurel crown
As likely to be blest in peace and war
And therefore I yield thee my free consent

WARWICK
And I choose Clarence only for Protector

KING HENRY
Warwick and Clarence give me both your hands
Now join your hands and with your hands your hearts
That no dissension hinder government
I make you both Protectors of this land
While I myself will lead a private life
And in devotion spend my latter days
To sins rebuke and my Creators praise

WARWICK
What answers Clarence to his sovereigns will

GEORGE
That he consents if Warwick yield consent
For on thy fortune I repose myself

WARWICK
Why then though loath yet I must be content
Well yoke together like a double shadow
To Henrys body and supply his place
I mean in bearing weight of government
While he enjoys the honour and his ease
And Clarence now then it is more than needful
Forthwith that Edward be pronounced a traitor
And all his lands and goods be confiscate

GEORGE
What else And that succession be determined

WARWICK
Ay therein Clarence shall not want his part

KING HENRY
But with the first of all your chief affairs
Let me entreatfor I command no more
That Margaret your Queen and my son Edward
Be sent for to return from France with speed
For till I see them here by doubtful fear
My joy of liberty is half eclipsed

GEORGE
It shall be done my sovereign with all speed

KING HENRY
My Lord of Somerset what youth is that
Of whom you seem to have so tender care

SOMERSET
My liege it is young Henry Earl of Richmond

KING HENRY
Come hither Englands hope If secret powers

Lays his hand on his head

Suggest but truth to my divining thoughts
This pretty lad will prove our countrys bliss
His looks are full of peaceful majesty
His head by nature framed to wear a crown
His hand to wield a sceptre and himself
Likely in time to bless a regal throne
Make much of him my lords for this is he
Must help you more than you are hurt by me

Enter a Post

WARWICK
What news my friend

POST
That Edward is escaped from your brother
And fled as he hears since to Burgundy

WARWICK
Unsavoury news But how made he escape

POST
He was conveyed by Richard Duke of Gloucester
And the Lord Hastings who attended him
In secret ambush on the forest side
And from the Bishops huntsmen rescued him
For hunting was his daily exercise

WARWICK
My brother was too careless of his charge
But let us hence my sovereign to provide
A salve for any sore that may betide

Exeunt all but Somerset Richmond and Oxford

SOMERSET
My lord I like not of this flight of Edwards
For doubtless Burgundy will yield him help
And we shall have more wars before t be long
As Henrys late presaging prophecy
Did glad my heart with hope of this young Richmond
So doth my heart misgive me in these conflicts
What may befall him to his harm and ours
Therefore Lord Oxford to prevent the worst
Forthwith well send him hence to Brittany
Till storms be past of civil enmity

OXFORD
Ay for if Edward repossess the crown
Tis like that Richmond with the rest shall down

SOMERSET
It shall be so He shall to Brittany
Come therefore lets about it speedily

Exeunt

SCENE VII Before York

Flourish Enter King Edward Richard Duke of Gloucester Hastings and
Soldiers

KING EDWARD
Now brother Richard Lord Hastings and the rest
Yet thus far Fortune maketh us amends
And says that once more I shall interchange
My waned state for Henrys regal crown
Well have we passed and now repassed the seas
And brought desired help from Burgundy
What then remains we being thus arrived
From Ravenspurgh haven before the gates of York
But that we enter as into our dukedom

RICHARD
The gates made fast Brother I like not this
For many men that stumble at the threshold
Are well foretold that danger lurks within

KING EDWARD
Tush man abodements must not now affright us
By fair or foul means we must enter in
For hither will our friends repair to us

HASTINGS
My liege Ill knock once more to summon them

Enter on the walls the Mayor of York and his Brethren

MAYOR
My lords we were forewarned of your coming
And shut the gates for safety of ourselves
For now we owe allegiance unto Henry

KING EDWARD
But master Mayor if Henry be your king
Yet Edward at the least is Duke of York

MAYOR
True my good lord I know you for no less

KING EDWARD
Why and I challenge nothing but my dukedom
As being well content with that alone

RICHARD
Aside But when the fox hath once got in his nose
Hell soon find means to make the body follow

HASTINGS
Why master Mayor why stand you in a doubt
Open the gates we are King Henrys friends

MAYOR
Ay say you so The gates shall then be opened

He descends

RICHARD
A wise stout captain and soon persuaded

HASTINGS
The good old man would fain that all were well
So twere not long of him but being entered
I doubt not I but we shall soon persuade
Both him and all his brothers unto reason

Enter the Mayor and two Aldermen below

KING EDWARD
So master Mayor these gates must not be shut
But in the night or in the time of war
What fear not man but yield me up the keys

Takes his keys

For Edward will defend the town and thee
And all those friends that deign to follow me

March Enter Montgomery with drum and Soldiers

RICHARD
Brother this is Sir John Montgomery
Our trusty friend unless I be deceived

KING EDWARD
Welcome Sir John But why come you in arms

MONTGOMERY
To help King Edward in his time of storm
As every loyal subject ought to do

KING EDWARD
Thanks good Montgomery but we now forget
Our title to the crown and only claim
Our dukedom till God please to send the rest

MONTGOMERY
Then fare you well for I will hence again
I came to serve a king and not a duke
Drummer strike up and let us march away

The drum begins to march

KING EDWARD
Nay stay Sir John a while and well debate
By what safe means the crown may be recovered

MONTGOMERY
What talk you of debating In few words
If youll not here proclaim yourself our king
Ill leave you to your fortune and be gone
To keep them back that come to succour you
Why shall we fight if you pretend no title

RICHARD
Why brother wherefore stand you on nice points

KING EDWARD
When we grow stronger then well make our claim
Till then tis wisdom to conceal our meaning

HASTINGS
Away with scrupulous wit Now arms must rule

RICHARD
And fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns
Brother we will proclaim you out of hand
The bruit thereof will bring you many friends

KING EDWARD
Then be it as you will for tis my right
And Henry but usurps the diadem

MONTGOMERY
Ay now my sovereign speaketh like himself
And now will I be Edwards champion

HASTINGS
Sound trumpet Edward shall be here proclaimed
Come fellow soldier make thou proclamation

Gives him a paper Flourish

SOLDIER
Reads Edward the Fourth by the Grace of God King of England and
France and Lord of Ireland etc

MONTGOMERY
And whosoer gainsays King Edwards right
By this I challenge him to single fight

Throws down his gauntlet

ALL
Long live Edward the Fourth

KING EDWARD
Thanks brave Montgomery and thanks unto you all
If Fortune serve me Ill requite this kindness
Now for this night lets harbour here in York
And when the morning sun shall raise his car
Above the border of this horizon
Well forward towards Warwick and his mates
For well I wot that Henry is no soldier
Ah froward Clarence how evil it beseems thee
To flatter Henry and forsake thy brother
Yet as we may well meet both thee and Warwick
Come on brave soldiers doubt not of the day
And that once gotten doubt not of large pay

Exeunt

SCENE VIII London The Palace

Flourish Enter King Henry Warwick Montague George Duke of
Clarence Oxford and Exeter

WARWICK
What counsel lords Edward from Belgia
With hasty Germans and blunt Hollanders
Hath passed in safety through the Narrow Seas
And with his troops doth march amain to London
And many giddy people flock to him

KING HENRY
Lets levy men and beat him back again

GEORGE
A little fire is quickly trodden out
Which being suffered rivers cannot quench

WARWICK
In Warwickshire I have truehearted friends
Not mutinous in peace yet bold in war
Those will I muster up and thou son Clarence
Shalt stir up in Suffolk Norfolk and in Kent
The knights and gentlemen to come with thee
Thou brother Montague in Buckingham
Northampton and in Leicestershire shalt find
Men well inclined to hear what thou commandst
And thou brave Oxford wondrous well beloved
In Oxfordshire shalt muster up thy friends
My sovereign with the loving citizens
Like to his island girt in with the ocean
Or modest Dian circled with her nymphs
Shall rest in London till we come to him
Fair lords take leave and stand not to reply
Farewell my sovereign

KING HENRY
Farewell my Hector and my Troys true hope

GEORGE
In sign of truth I kiss your Highness hand

KING HENRY
Wellminded Clarence be thou fortunate

MONTAGUE
Comfort my lord and so I take my leave

OXFORD
And thus kissing Henrys hand I seal my truth and bid adieu

KING HENRY
Sweet Oxford and my loving Montague
And all at once once more a happy farewell

WARWICK
Farewell sweet lords lets meet at Coventry

Exeunt all but King Henry and Exeter

KING HENRY
Here at the palace will I rest a while
Cousin of Exeter what thinks your lordship
Methinks the power that Edward hath in field
Should not be able to encounter mine

EXETER
The doubt is that he will seduce the rest

KING HENRY
Thats not my fear my meed hath got me fame
I have not stopped mine ears to their demands
Nor posted off their suits with slow delays
My pity hath been balm to heal their wounds
My mildness hath allayed their swelling griefs
My mercy dried their waterflowing tears
I have not been desirous of their wealth
Nor much oppressed them with great subsidies
Nor forward of revenge though they much erred
Then why should they love Edward more than me
No Exeter these graces challenge grace
And when the lion fawns upon the lamb
The lamb will never cease to follow him

Shout within A York A York

EXETER
Hark hark my lord what shouts are these

Enter King Edward Richard Duke of Gloucester and Soldiers

KING EDWARD
Seize on the shamefaced Henry bear him hence
And once again proclaim us King of England
You are the fount that makes small brooks to flow
Now stops thy spring my sea shall suck them dry
And swell so much the higher by their ebb
Hence with him to the Tower Let him not speak

Exeunt some with King Henry

And lords towards Coventry bend we our course
Where peremptory Warwick now remains
The sun shines hot and if we use delay
Cold biting winter mars our hopedfor hay

RICHARD
Away betimes before his forces join
And take the greatgrown traitor unawares
Brave warriors march amain towards Coventry

Exeunt

WARWICK

Where is the post that came from Montague

2 MESSENGER
By this at Daintry with a puissant troop

Enter Sir John Somerville

WARWICK
Say Somerville what says my loving son
And by thy guess how nigh is Clarence now

SOMERVILLE
At Southam I did leave him with his forces
And do expect him here some two hours hence

Drum heard

WARWICK
Then Clarence is at hand I hear his drum

SOMERVILLE
It is not his my lord here Southam lies
The drum your honour hears marcheth from Warwick

WARWICK

SOMERVILLE
They are at hand and you shall quickly know

March Flourish Enter King Edward Richard Duke of Gloucester and
Soldiers

KING EDWARD
Go trumpet to the walls and sound a parle

RICHARD
See how the surly Warwick mans the wall

WARWICK
O unbid spite Is sportful Edward come
Where slept our scouts or how are they seduced
That we could hear no news of his repair

KING EDWARD
Now Warwick wilt thou ope the city gates
Speak gentle words and humbly bend thy knee
Call Edward King and at his hands beg mercy
And he shall pardon thee these outrages

WARWICK
Nay rather wilt thou draw thy forces hence
Confess who set thee up and plucked thee down
Call Warwick patron and be penitent
And thou shalt still remain the Duke of York

RICHARD
I thought at least he would have said the King
Or did he make the jest against his will

WARWICK
Is not a dukedom sir a goodly gift

RICHARD
Ay by my faith for a poor earl to give
Ill do thee service for so good a gift

WARWICK
Twas I that gave the kingdom to thy brother

KING EDWARD
Why then tis mine if but by Warwicks gift

WARWICK
Thou art no Atlas for so great a weight
And weakling Warwick takes his gift again
And Henry is my King Warwick his subject

KING EDWARD
But Warwicks king is Edwards prisoner
And gallant Warwick do but answer this
What is the body when the head is off

RICHARD
Alas that Warwick had no more forecast
But whiles he thought to steal the single ten
The king was slily fingered from the deck
You left poor Henry at the Bishops palace
And ten to one youll meet him in the Tower

KING EDWARD
Tis even so yet you are Warwick still

RICHARD
Come Warwick take the time kneel down kneel down
Nay when Strike now or else the iron cools

WARWICK
I had rather chop this hand off at a blow
And with the other fling it at thy face
Than bear so low a sail to strike to thee

KING EDWARD
Sail how thou canst have wind and tide thy friend
This hand fast wound about thy coalblack hair
Shall whiles thy head is warm and new cut off
Write in the dust this sentence with thy blood
Windchanging Warwick now can change no more

Enter Oxford with drum and colours

WARWICK
O cheerful colours See where Oxford comes

OXFORD
Oxford Oxford for Lancaster

He and his forces enter the city

RICHARD
The gates are open let us enter too

KING EDWARD
So other foes may set upon our backs
Stand we in good array for they no doubt
Will issue out again and bid us battle
If not the city being but of small defence
Well quietly rouse the traitors in the same

WARWICK
O welcome Oxford for we want thy help

Enter Montague with drum and colours

MONTAGUE
Montague Montague for Lancaster

He and his forces enter the city

RICHARD
Thou and thy brother both shall buy this treason
Even with the dearest blood your bodies bear

KING EDWARD
The harder matched the greater victory
My mind presageth happy gain and conquest

Enter Somerset with drum and colours

SOMERSET
Somerset Somerset for Lancaster

He and his forces enter the city

RICHARD
Two of thy name both Dukes of Somerset
Have sold their lives unto the House of York
And thou shalt be the third if this sword hold

Enter George Duke of Clarence with drum and colours

WARWICK
And lo where George of Clarence sweeps along
Of force enough to bid his brother battle
With whom an upright zeal to right prevails
More than the nature of a brothers love

Richard and George whisper

Come Clarence come thou wilt if Warwick call

GEORGE
Father of Warwick know you what this means

Taking the red rose from his hat and throws the rose at Warwick

Look here I throw my infamy at thee
I will not ruinate my fathers house
Who gave his blood to lime the stones together
And set up Lancaster Why trowest thou Warwick
That Clarence is so harsh so blunt unnatural
To bend the fatal instruments of war
Against his brother and his lawful King
Perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath
To keep that oath were more impiety
Than Jephthahs when he sacrificed his daughter
I am so sorry for my trespass made
That to deserve well at my brothers hands
I here proclaim myself thy mortal foe
With resolution wheresoer I meet thee
As I will meet thee if thou stir abroad
To plague thee for thy foul misleading me
And so proudhearted Warwick I defy thee
And to my brother turn my blushing cheeks
Pardon me Edward I will make amends
And Richard do not frown upon my faults
For I will henceforth be no more unconstant

KING EDWARD
Now welcome more and ten times more beloved
Than if thou never hadst deserved our hate

RICHARD
Welcome good Clarence this is brotherlike

WARWICK
O passing traitor perjured and unjust

KING EDWARD
What Warwick wilt thou leave the town and fight
Or shall we beat the stones about thine ears

WARWICK
Alas I am not cooped here for defence
I will away towards Barnet presently
And bid thee battle Edward if thou darst

KING EDWARD
Yes Warwick Edward dares and leads the way
Lords to the field Saint George and victory

Exeunt March Warwick and his company follows

SCENE II A Field of Battle near Barnet

Alarum and excursions Enter King Edward bringing forth Warwick
wounded

KING EDWARD
So lie thou there Die thou and die our fear
For Warwick was a bug that feared us all
Now Montague sit fast I seek for thee
That Warwicks bones may keep thine company

Exit

WARWICK
Ah who is nigh Come to me friend or foe
And tell me who is victor York or Warwick
Why ask I that My mangled body shows
My blood my want of strength my sick heart shows
That I must yield my body to the earth
And by my fall the conquest to my foe
Thus yields the cedar to the axes edge
Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle
Under whose shade the ramping lion slept
Whose top branch overpeered Joves spreading tree
And kept low shrubs from winters powrful wind
These eyes that now are dimmed with deaths black veil
Have been as piercing as the midday sun
To search the secret treasons of the world
The wrinkles in my brows now filled with blood
Were likened oft to kingly sepulchres
For who lived King but I could dig his grave
And who durst smile when Warwick bent his brow
Lo now my glory smeared in dust and blood
My parks my walks my manors that I had
Even now forsake me and of all my lands
Is nothing left me but my bodys length
Why what is pomp rule reign but earth and dust
And live we how we can yet die we must

Enter Oxford and Somerset

SOMERSET
Ah Warwick Warwick wert thou as we are
We might recover all our loss again
The Queen from France hath brought a puissant power
Even now we heard the news Ah couldst thou fly

WARWICK
Why then I would not fly Ah Montague
If thou be there sweet brother take my hand
And with thy lips keep in my soul awhile
Thou lovst me not for brother if thou didst
Thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood
That glues my lips and will not let me speak
Come quickly Montague or I am dead

SOMERSET
Ah Warwick Montague hath breathed his last
And to the latest gasp cried out for Warwick
And said Commend me to my valiant brother
And more he would have said and more he spoke
Which sounded like a cannon in a vault
That mought not be distinguished but at last
I well might hear delivered with a groan
O farewell Warwick

WARWICK
Sweet rest his soul Fly lords and save yourselves
For Warwick bids you all farewell to meet in heaven

He dies

OXFORD
Away away to meet the Queens great power

Here they bear away his body Exeunt

SCENE III Another Part of the Field

Flourish Enter King Edward in triumph with Richard George and the
rest

KING EDWARD
Thus far our fortune keeps an upward course
And we are graced with wreaths of victory
But in the midst of this brightshining day
I spy a black suspicious threatning cloud
That will encounter with our glorious sun
Ere he attain his easeful western bed
I mean my lords those powers that the Queen
Hath raised in Gallia have arrived our coast
And as we hear march on to fight with us

GEORGE
A little gale will soon disperse that cloud
And blow it to the source from whence it came
Thy very beams will dry those vapours up
For every cloud engenders not a storm

RICHARD
The Queen is valued thirty thousand strong
And Somerset with Oxford fled to her
If she have time to breathe be well assured
Her faction will be full as strong as ours

KING EDWARD
We are advertised by our loving friends
That they do hold their course toward Tewkesbury
We having now the best at Barnet field
Will thither straight for willingness rids way
And as we march our strength will be augmented
In every county as we go along
Strike up the drum cry Courage and away

Exeunt

SCENE IV Plains near Tewkesbury

Flourish March Enter Queen Margaret Prince Edward Somerset Oxford
and Soldiers

QUEEN MARGARET
Great lords wise men neer sit and wail their loss
But cheerly seek how to redress their harms
What though the mast be now blown overboard
The cable broke the holdinganchor lost
And half our sailors swallowed in the flood
Yet lives our pilot still Is t meet that he
Should leave the helm and like a fearful lad
With tearful eyes add water to the sea
And give more strength to that which hath too much
Whiles in his moan the ship splits on the rock
Which industry and courage might have saved
Ah what a shame ah what a fault were this
Say Warwick was our anchor what of that
And Montague our topmast what of him
Our slaughtered friends the tackles what of these
Why is not Oxford here another anchor
And Somerset another goodly mast
The friends of France our shrouds and tacklings
And though unskilful why not Ned and I
For once allowed the skilful pilots charge
We will not from the helm to sit and weep
But keep our course though the rough wind say no
From shelves and rocks that threaten us with wrack
As good to chide the waves as speak them fair
And what is Edward but a ruthless sea
What Clarence but a quicksand of deceit
And Richard but a ragged fatal rock
All these the enemies to our poor bark
Say you can swim alas tis but a while
Tread on the sand why there you quickly sink
Bestride the rock the tide will wash you off
Or else you famish thats a threefold death
This speak I lords to let you understand
If case some one of you would fly from us
That theres no hopedfor mercy with the brothers
More than with ruthless waves with sands and rocks
Why courage then What cannot be avoided
Twere childish weakness to lament or fear

PRINCE EDWARD
Methinks a woman of this valiant spirit
Should if a coward heard her speak these words
Infuse his breast with magnanimity
And make him naked foil a man at arms
I speak not this as doubting any here
For did I but suspect a fearful man
He should have leave to go away betimes
Lest in our need he might infect another
And make him of the like spirit to himself
If any such be here as God forbid
Let him depart before we need his help

OXFORD
Women and children of so high a courage
And warriors faint Why twere perpetual shame
O brave young Prince thy famous grandfather
Doth live again in thee Long mayst thou live
To bear his image and renew his glories

SOMERSET
And he that will not fight for such a hope
Go home to bed and like the owl by day
If he arise be mocked and wondered at

QUEEN MARGARET
Thanks gentle Somerset Sweet Oxford thanks

PRINCE EDWARD
And take his thanks that yet hath nothing else

Enter a Messenger

MESSENGER
Prepare you lords for Edward is at hand
Ready to fight therefore be resolute

OXFORD
I thought no less It is his policy
To haste thus fast to find us unprovided

SOMERSET
But hes deceived we are in readiness

QUEEN MARGARET
This cheers my heart to see your forwardness

OXFORD
Here pitch our battle hence we will not budge

Flourish and march Enter King Edward Richard George and Soldiers

KING EDWARD
Brave followers yonder stands the thorny wood
Which by the heavens assistance and your strength
Must by the roots be hewn up yet ere night
I need not add more fuel to your fire
For well I wot ye blaze to burn them out
Give signal to the fight and to it lords

QUEEN MARGARET
Lords knights and gentlemen what I should say
My tears gainsay for every word I speak
Ye see I drink the water of my eye
Therefore no more but this Henry your sovereign
Is prisoner to the foe his state usurped
His realm a slaughterhouse his subjects slain
His statutes cancelled and his treasure spent
And yonder is the wolf that makes this spoil
You fight in justice Then in Gods name lords
Be valiant and give signal to the fight

Alarum retreat excursions Exeunt both armies

SCENE V Another part of the Field

Flourish Enter King Edward Richard George and Soldiers with Queen
Margaret Oxford and Somerset as prisoners

KING EDWARD
Now here a period of tumultuous broils
Away with Oxford to Hames Castle straight
For Somerset off with his guilty head
Go bear them hence I will not hear them speak

OXFORD
For my part Ill not trouble thee with words

SOMERSET
Nor I but stoop with patience to my fortune

Exeunt Oxford and Somerset guarded

QUEEN MARGARET
So part we sadly in this troublous world
To meet with joy in sweet Jerusalem

KING EDWARD
Is proclamation made that who finds Edward
Shall have a high reward and he his life

RICHARD
It is and lo where youthful Edward comes

Enter soldiers with Prince Edward

KING EDWARD
Bring forth the gallant let us hear him speak
What can so young a man begin to prick
Edward what satisfaction canst thou make
For bearing arms for stirring up my subjects
And all the trouble thou hast turned me to

PRINCE EDWARD
Speak like a subject proud ambitious York
Suppose that I am now my fathers mouth
Resign thy chair and where I stand kneel thou
Whilst I propose the selfsame words to thee
Which traitor thou wouldst have me answer to

QUEEN MARGARET
Ah thy father had been so resolved

RICHARD
That you might still have worn the petticoat
And neer have stoln the breech from Lancaster

PRINCE EDWARD
Let Aesop fable in a winters night
His currish riddle sorts not with this place

RICHARD
By heaven brat Ill plague you for that word

QUEEN MARGARET
Ay thou wast born to be a plague to men

RICHARD
For Gods sake take away this captive scold

PRINCE EDWARD
Nay take away this scolding crookback rather

KING EDWARD
Peace wilful boy or I will charm your tongue

GEORGE
Untutored lad thou art too malapert

PRINCE EDWARD
I know my duty you are all undutiful
Lascivious Edward and thou perjured George
And thou misshapen Dick I tell ye all
I am your better traitors as ye are
And thou usurpst my fathers right and mine

KING EDWARD
Take that the likeness of this railer here

Stabs him

RICHARD
Sprawlst thou Take that to end thy agony

Stabs him

GEORGE
And theres for twitting me with perjury

Stabs him

QUEEN MARGARET

RICHARD
Marry and shall

Offers to kill her

KING EDWARD
Hold Richard hold for we have done too much

RICHARD
Why should she live to fill the world with words

KING EDWARD
What doth she swoon Use means for her recovery

RICHARD
Clarence excuse me to the King my brother
Ill hence to London on a serious matter
Ere ye come there be sure to hear some news

GEORGE
What What

RICHARD
The Tower the Tower

Exit

QUEEN MARGARET
O Ned sweet Ned speak to thy mother boy
Canst thou not speak O traitors murderers
They that stabbed Caesar shed no blood at all
Did not offend nor were not worthy blame
If this foul deed were by to equal it
He was a man this in respect a child
And men neer spend their fury on a child
Whats worse than murderer that I may name it
No no my heart will burst an if I speak
And I will speak that so my heart may burst
Butchers and villains bloody cannibals
How sweet a plant have you untimely cropped
You have no children butchers if you had
The thought of them would have stirred up remorse
But if you ever chance to have a child
Look in his youth to have him so cut off
As deathsmen you have rid this sweet young prince

KING EDWARD
Away with her go bear her hence perforce

QUEEN MARGARET
Nay never bear me hence dispatch me here
Here sheathe thy sword Ill pardon thee my death
What wilt thou not Then Clarence do it thou

GEORGE
By heaven I will not do thee so much ease

QUEEN MARGARET
Good Clarence do sweet Clarence do thou do it

GEORGE
Didst thou not hear me swear I would not do it

QUEEN MARGARET
Ay but thou usest to forswear thyself
Twas sin before but now tis charity
What wilt thou not Where is that devils butcher Richard
Hardfavoured Richard Richard where art thou
Thou art not here Murder is thy almsdeed
Petitioners for blood thou neer puttst back

KING EDWARD

QUEEN MARGARET
So come to you and yours as to this prince

KING EDWARD

To make a bloody supper in the Tower

KING EDWARD

With pay and thanks and lets away to London
And see our gentle Queen how well she fares
By this I hope she hath a son for me

Exeunt

SCENE VI London The Tower

Enter King Henry and Richard with the Lieutenant on the walls

RICHARD
Good day my lord What at your book so hard

KING HENRY
Ay my good lordmy lord I should say rather
Tis sin to flatter good was little better
Good Gloucester and good devil were alike
And both preposterous therefore not good lord

RICHARD
Sirrah leave us to ourselves we must confer

Exit Lieutenant

KING HENRY
So flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf
So first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece
And next his throat unto the butchers knife
What scene of death hath Roscius now to act

RICHARD
Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind
The thief doth fear each bush an officer

KING HENRY
The bird that hath been limed in a bush
With trembling wings misdoubteth every bush
And I the hapless male to one sweet bird
Have now the fatal object in my eye
Where my poor young was limed was caught and killed

RICHARD
Why what a peevish fool was that of Crete
That taught his son the office of a fowl
And yet for all his wings the fool was drowned

KING HENRY
I Daedalus my poor boy Icarus
Thy father Minos that denied our course
The sun that seared the wings of my sweet boy
Thy brother Edward and thyself the sea
Whose envious gulf did swallow up his life
Ah kill me with thy weapon not with words
My breast can better brook thy daggers point
Than can my ears that tragic history
But wherefore dost thou come Is t for my life

RICHARD
Thinkst thou I am an executioner

KING HENRY
A persecutor I am sure thou art
If murdering innocents be executing
Why then thou art an executioner

RICHARD
Thy son I killed for his presumption

KING HENRY
Hadst thou been killed when first thou didst presume
Thou hadst not lived to kill a son of mine
And thus I prophesy that many a thousand
Which now mistrust no parcel of my fear
And many an old mans sigh and many a widows
And many an orphans waterstanding eye
Men for their sons wives for their husbands
Orphans for their parents timeless death
Shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born
The owl shrieked at thy birth an evil sign
The nightcrow cried aboding luckless time
Dogs howled and hideous tempest shook down trees
The raven rooked her on the chimneys top
And chattring pies in dismal discord sung
Thy mother felt more than a mothers pain
And yet brought forth less than a mothers hope
To wit an indigested and deformed lump
Not like the fruit of such a goodly tree
Teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born
To signify thou camst to bite the world
And if the rest be true which I have heard
Thou camst

RICHARD
Ill hear no more Die prophet in thy speech

Stabs him

For this amongst the rest was I ordained

KING HENRY
Ay and for much more slaughter after this
O God forgive my sins and pardon thee

Dies

RICHARD
What will the aspiring blood of Lancaster
Sink in the ground I thought it would have mounted
See how my sword weeps for the poor Kings death
O may such purple tears be always shed
From those that wish the downfall of our house
If any spark of life be yet remaining
Down down to hell and say I sent thee thither

Stabs him again

I that have neither pity love nor fear
Indeed tis true that Henry told me of
For I have often heard my mother say
I came into the world with my legs forward
Had I not reason think ye to make haste
And seek their ruin that usurped our right
The midwife wondered and the women cried
O Jesus bless us he is born with teeth
And so I was which plainly signified
That I should snarl and bite and play the dog
Then since the heavens have shaped my body so
Let hell make crooked my mind to answer it
I have no brother I am like no brother
And this word love which greybeards call divine
Be resident in men like one another
And not in me I am myself alone
Clarence beware thou keepst me from the light
But I will sort a pitchy day for thee
For I will buzz abroad such prophecies
That Edward shall be fearful of his life
And then to purge his fear Ill be thy death
King Henry and the Prince his son are gone
Clarence thy turn is next and then the rest
Counting myself but bad till I be best
Ill throw thy body in another room
And triumph Henry in thy day of doom

Exit with the body

SCENE VII London The Palace

Flourish Enter King Edward Queen Elizabeth George Richard
Hastings Nurse carrying infant Prince Edward and Attendants

KING EDWARD
Once more we sit in Englands royal throne
Repurchased with the blood of enemies
What valiant foemen like to autumns corn
Have we mowed down in tops of all their pride
Three Dukes of Somerset threefold renowned
For hardy and undoubted champions
Two Cliffords as the father and the son
And two Northumberlands two braver men
Neer spurred their coursers at the trumpets sound
With them the two brave bears Warwick and Montague
That in their chains fettered the kingly lion
And made the forest tremble when they roared
Thus have we swept suspicion from our seat
And made our footstool of security
Come hither Bess and let me kiss my boy
Young Ned for thee thine uncles and myself
Have in our armours watched the winters night
Went all afoot in summers scalding heat
That thou mightst repossess the crown in peace
And of our labours thou shalt reap the gain

RICHARD
Aside Ill blast his harvest if your head were laid
For yet I am not looked on in the world
This shoulder was ordained so thick to heave
And heave it shall some weight or break my back
Work thou the way and that shall execute

KING EDWARD
Clarence and Gloucester love my lovely Queen
And kiss your princely nephew brothers both

GEORGE
The duty that I owe unto your Majesty
I seal upon the lips of this sweet babe

QUEEN ELIZABETH
Thanks noble Clarence worthy brother thanks

RICHARD
And that I love the tree from whence thou sprangst
Witness the loving kiss I give the fruit
Aside To say the truth so Judas kissed his master
And cried All hail when as he meant all harm

KING EDWARD
Now am I seated as my soul delights
Having my countrys peace and brothers loves

GEORGE
What will your Grace have done with Margaret
Reignier her father to the King of France
Hath pawned the Sicils and Jerusalem
And hither have they sent it for her ransom

KING EDWARD
Away with her and waft her hence to France
And now what rests but that we spend the time
With stately triumphs mirthful comic shows
Such as befits the pleasure of the court
Sound drums and trumpets Farewell sour annoy
For here I hope begins our lasting joy

Exeunt
